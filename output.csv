"NBA stars and mafia among dozens arrested in illegal gambling crackdown It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmpp3x5x5o,"– An NBA player and coach are among dozens of people arrested as part of a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were named by federal prosecutors in two separate indictments on Thursday.Rozier, 31, is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities, including other NBA players who may have faked injuries to influence gambling markets.Billups, a Hall of Fame player who has coached the Portland Trail Blazers since 2021, is one of 31 people charged in a separate illegal poker game case involving retired players and the mafia.Rozier is due to appear in federal court in Orlando later on Thursday, while Billups was arrested in Portland and will appear in court there. FBI Director Kash Patel held a news conference with other prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday where he announced the two indictments.He called the arrests ""extraordinary"" and said there was a ""co-ordinated takedown across 11 states.""We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation,"" he said.US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph Nocella Jr., said all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, but warned: ""Your winning streak has ended.Your luck has run out.""Rozier is alleged to have told a friend that he would leave the game early due to injury.Rozier is said to have played roughly nine minutes and scored just five points because of a sore right foot, according to the official NBA match report.Rozier's lawyer denied the allegations to CBS News, saying: ""Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.""",Positive
"X-ray tables, high-tech glasses, NBA players: How a poker scheme allegedly stole millions Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6nd9wnzn6o,"– Celebrities, professional sports stars, and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these ""unwitting"" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m (£1.35m). The scheme, which US prosecutors described as ""reminiscent of a Hollywood movie,"" was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Costra Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. Arrests in the scheme were announced Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, where professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse, and Genovese. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as ""face cards"", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, ""unwitting victim"" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator, who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - which prosecutors call a 'quarterback' or 'driver.'",Negative
"South Korea's fishermen keep dying. Is climate change to blame? An increase in deadly incidents has been partly caused by climate change, an inquiry found.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg924nrgd3o,"– South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous.It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula—alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons—increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.""Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,"" he told the BBC.This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines.Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.Over the past two years, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems—the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower.Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea—a 75% jump from the year before.",Negative
New images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expected Israel has placed boundary markers up to 520m deeper inside Gaza than expected under the ceasefire deal with Hamas.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y00g4x29o,"– The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: ""IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.""There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump, and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz—who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers— warned that anyone crossing the line ""will be met with fire.""There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump, and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October.But new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of meters deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line. Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: ""IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground.""If these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.""This gives the IDF space to maneuver and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,"" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said.",Positive
Watch: Video appears to show alleged Louvre jewel thieves escaping Thieves stole €88m worth of French crown jewels in broad daylight on Sunday morning.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c4g39dnyky1o,"– Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight. Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and 88m-worth (£77m) of France's crown jewels were stolen. The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed. In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way. The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.",Negative
EU fails to back frozen Russian cash loan - but vows to support Ukraine Leaders pushed back a decision on Moscow's assets until December after Belgium raised concerns.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8v0zyx9zyo,"– EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's ""financial needs"" for the next two years on Thursday night—but stopped short of releasing billions of euros in frozen Russian cash to help fund the country's defense. The controversial move would be on top of sanctions the block has imposed on Russia—the latest on Thursday targeting the Kremlin's oil revenues.The Brussels meeting came ahead of a London summit on Friday, where Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will urge European leaders to boost long-range missile supplies to Kyiv.The EU's latest punitive measures against Russia targeted three Chinese businesses, including two oil refineries and an energy trader, that are ""significant buyers of Russian crude oil.""China condemned the decision, which a commerce ministry spokesperson said ""seriously undermined the overall framework of China–EU economic and trade co-operation.""Russia should take good note of this: Ukraine will have the financial resources it needs to defend itself,"" he told a news conference.",Neutral
"Warships, fighter jets and the CIA - what is Trump's endgame in Venezuela? President Trump says he wants to tackle the drugs trade but many believe he is trying to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo,"– The US has upped its bounty for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m, an incentive for those within his loyal, inner circle to hand him in.But it has yielded no defections.Venezuelan law professor and senior associate at the CSIS national security think tank, Jose Ignacio Hernndez, says $50m is ""nothing"" for Venezuela's elites.He argues the military build-up is a show of strength intended to ""strike fear"" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry ""narcotics"" and ""narco-terrorists"", without providing evidence or details about those on board.It is no secret that the US administration, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would like to see Maduro toppled.Earlier this year, he told Fox News Maduro was a ""horrible dictator"" and when asked whether he was demanding that Maduro leave, added: ""We're going to work on that policy.""But, even for overt critics of Maduro like Rubio, it is difficult to explicitly call for military-backed regime change - something Venezuela's opposition has longed called for.Donald Trump campaigned against regime change in 2016, pledging to ""stop racing to topple foreign regimes"" and more recently has condemned engaging in ""forever wars.""",Negative

King and Pope make history by praying side by side,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnve5mdze8yo,"– King Charles and Pope Leo made history in the Sistine Chapel by praying side by side—a first for the leaders of the Church of England and Catholic Church.Under the scrutinising eyes of Michelangelo's Last Judgment, when Pope Leo said ""let us pray"", it meant everyone, including the King, closing a gap that stretched back to the Reformation in the 16th Century.With music and prayers about nature that would bridge any theological divide, the service offered the King and Queen some calm amid scrutiny over Prince Andrew during their Vatican visit.But despite the significance of the state visit, there was no escaping the media—with questions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that show no sign of abating.In the Sistine Chapel the Catholic and Anglican choirs literally sang from the same hymn sheet.The symbolic point of coming here was that before the Reformation this was a church associated with the English monarchy.But they returned to the huge and gorgeously embellished basilica above.There were exchanges of gifts, including an icon given to Pope Leo, reflecting the King's fascination with the Orthodox Church and its images.There were also knighthoods exchanged between King Charles and Pope Leo, but at the moment there might be a question about the value of honors.For Buckingham Palace, it will have been the completion of a state visit that had previously been postponed by the ill-health of Pope Francis.",Positive
