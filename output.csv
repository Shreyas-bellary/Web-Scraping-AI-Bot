Allies of US in the Gulf bear brunt of Iran attacks Iran's attacks on Gulf Arab states suggest the Islamic Republic is targeting not just the US military but also civilian infrastructure.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jk922dgjgo,"– In the clear blue skies above Abu Dhabi, white contrails streak high above the sand-coloured villas and well-watered gardens. They are incoming ballistic missiles, launched by the Emirates' giant neighbor just across the Gulf: Iran. As of Sunday afternoon, the United Arab Emirates' defense ministry said it had so far ""dealt with"" 165 incoming ballistic missiles, two cruise missiles, and 541 Iranian drones. Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Aragchi, has denied targeting his country's neighbors, telling Al Jazeera: ""We are not attacking our neighbors in the Persian Gulf countries, we are targeting the presence of the US in these countries. Neighbours should direct their grievances to the decision-makers of this war."" The number of attacks on airports in Bahrain and the UAE point to more than coincidence. Iran always made it clear in advance that, if it was attacked, it would retaliate at any country it considered to be complicit in that attack. The Gulf states went to some lengths to show Iran they were not part, in their eyes, of this US-Israeli attack. But for rulers of the Gulf states - conservative, dynastic monarchies for whom the revolutionary zeal of the Islamic Republic is anathema - a line has been crossed here.",Negative
"Iran's regime is still intact - the coming days will show if it can hold out Iran's surviving leaders are in crisis mode, battling to project security as US and Israel strikes continue.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lgvg5rl1o,"– The killing of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, in the opening wave of joint US-Israeli strikes has pushed the Islamic Republic into its most precarious moment since 1979. The operation targeted senior military and political leadership in what Washington described as a decisive effort to cripple Iran's command structure. On Sunday morning, Iranian state television formally confirmed Khamenei's death, before swiftly announcing the formation of a temporary council of three men to assume executive authority. Under Iran's constitution, the selection of a new supreme leader falls to the Assembly of Experts - an 88-member clerical body elected by popular vote for eight-year terms. The precedent from June 1989, when Khamenei himself emerged as supreme leader despite not being widely viewed as a frontrunner, is a reminder that the outcome can defy expectations. The coming days will reveal whether the IRGC and other elements of the country's coercive apparatus can remain in the absence of its long-serving supreme leader.",Positive
Watch: Retaliations continue on day two of US-Israel attacks on Iran Donald Trump warned of more US deaths after three US service members have been killed in action on the second day of US-Israel attack on Iran.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvgk8vj56v1o,"– US President Donald Trump warned ""there will likely be more"" US casualties during operations in Iran in a statement posted on Truth Social. This comes as US Central Command (Centcom) said three US service members have been killed in action and five ""seriously wounded."" In Israel, nine people have been killed after a missile strike in the city of Beit Shemesh, according to medical services. Meanwhile Iranian officials say at least 153 people including children were killed after a reported strike hit a school on Saturday, according to Iranian officials. Centcom said it was looking into reports of the incident, while Israel's military said it was ""not aware"" of any IDF operations in the area.",Negative
Months of planning behind US-Israeli mission to target Iran's supreme leader A piece of crucial intelligence arrived just hours before the attack on a compound in central Tehran.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86y5540vnno,"– Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came not in the middle of the night, as might have been expected, but in the middle of the morning. That was because the US and Israel decided to take advantage of a piece of crucial intelligence that had arrived hours before. For months, they had been watching for a moment of opportunity when senior Iranian figures might be meeting and they learned Khamenei was going to be at a compound in central Tehran on Saturday morning. They also had a fix on the location of other senior military and intelligence figures meeting at the same time. Iran knew the supreme leader was in the sights of its enemies and so the failure to identify and deal with these vulnerabilities in the intervening months suggests a deep failure for Iranian security and counterintelligence or else the ability of Israel and the US to continue to adapt their methods to find new ways of tracking.",Positive
Oil prices rise after ships attacked near Strait of Hormuz Experts have warned that a prolonged conflict could push global energy prices even higher.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75evve6l63o,"– Iran and Israel launched fresh aerial attacks against each other on Sunday, after US-Israeli strikes killed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday and prompted retaliatory strikes on several countries in the Middle East.
