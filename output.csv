"White House says layoffs 'imminent' with no end to shutdown in sight As a bitter standoff between Republicans and Democrats plays out, there is little sign that either side is willing to budge.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrwdny8p1o,"– Mass layoffs of US federal workers will begin within two days, the White House says, as lawmakers trade blame over the first government shutdown in almost seven years.The shutdown began on Wednesday after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to agree a new spending plan before the midnight deadline.There is little sign that either side is willing to compromise, and a vote to end the shutdown failed just hours after it began.The Senate has since adjourned, raising fears that the shutdown could drag on and threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs as well as risk costing the US economy billions in lost output.At a White House briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Vice-President JD Vance made a rare appearance alongside Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and accused the Democrats of playing political games with the shutdown.Vance also made the claim - repeatedly denied by Democrats - that the shutdown is a result of senior Democrats advocating for healthcare benefits to be extended to undocumented migrants.Analysts expect that this shutdown to be bigger than the last one in 2018, when Congress had passed some funding bills.It was the latest dig in what has been a bitter blame game between both parties, with the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer earlier accusing Republicans of trying to ""bully"" Democrats into accepting their funding plan.",Negative
"Four ways this shutdown could eventually end At some point, public pressure and political pain will see one side yield to bring this latest US government shutdown to an end.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo,"– It may take days; it may take weeks, but eventually, as public pressure and political pain grows, one side or the other will yield.Here are four scenarios for how that might play out.Senate Democrats shot down a Republican spending bill that would have kept the government operating until November, but that vote may have contained the seeds of their defeat.While 40 four Democrats (and Republican iconoclast Rand Paul) voted no, two Democrats and one Democrat-allied independent sided with the Republican majority.Independent Angus King of Maine is always a bit of a wildcard.Republican Senate leader John Thune says that he is already hearing from some Democrats who are uneasy with the way the shutdown is playing out.There were no new defections during the vote on Wednesday, but if five more Democrats break ranks, the shutdown will end—whether the rest of the Democratic Party wants it to or not. Government employees are a key constituency in the party, and they will be the ones feeling the pain most immediately from delayed paycheques and the possibility that the Trump administration will use the shutdown to further slash programs and turn their furloughs into permanent unemployment.The American public as a whole will also start feeling the bite through curtailed government services and economic disruption.",Negative

"China launches a new visa to attract tech talent, but locals aren't happy China's aim to attract global talent comes as the US is making it harder to bring in foreign workers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4eeerzrwo,"– China's K visa, which went into effect on Wednesday, was thrust into the public spotlight last week, when an Indian outlet referred to it as ""China's H-1B""—a reference to the US visa for skilled workers which was, last month, targeted by an executive order by Donald Trump.The Indian media report was picked up widely in China, stoking concern—and even fears— amongst the public over whether benefits extended to foreigners would increase competition in a sluggish job market—and in a country that has traditionally not been a major immigration destination for foreign professionals.And although it is still unclear whether the visa will actually allow foreigners to work in China or whether it just allows them easier access into the country, it didn't stop tens of thousands of users on Chinese social media from criticizing the program.""We have so many bachelor's degree holders, not to mention even more with master's and doctoral degrees. We already have a surplus of domestic talent—and now you're bringing in foreign college graduates?"" read one comment.It is not yet clear what the program fully entails, but the Chinese government has said it applies to individuals working in STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.Authorities have described it as a visa for ""exchanges related to education, science and technology, culture, as well as entrepreneurship and business activities.""It did not provide further details on age requirements or which universities would qualify for the scheme.The backlash reflects a pattern of public scrutiny and criticism in China over what is perceived as preferential treatment for foreigners, according to Interfax.",Negative
