Trump raises tariffs on Canadian goods over Reagan advert The US president announces he is adding 10% to current levies on one of the biggest US trading partners.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ljgrm78zo,"– Donald Trump has said he is adding 10% to US tariffs on goods imported from Canada, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.Calling the advert a ""fraud"", the US president lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship.Prime Minister Mark Carney said in response that Canada was ready ""to continue to build on the progress we had been making"" in trade talks, but added that it was developing trade relationships with other countries.Canada is the only G7 country to not reach a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to levy steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement.Trump said while traveling to Asia on Saturday that he was ""increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now.""Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticized the advert for using ""selective"" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign ""so that trade talks can resume"", after the US cut off discussions over the advert featuring Reagan, a Republican president and conservative icon.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down ""IMMEDIATELY.""Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,"" the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said.",Positive

"A humming annoyance or jobs boom? Life next to 199 data centres Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy. Now, residents are concerned about their impact on real estate and electricity costs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93dnnxewdvo,"– When you cross into Loudon County, Virginia, one of the first things you notice is the hum—that's the sound of 199 data centers whirring in the background.Few people have heard of this inconspicuous part of northern Virginia, which also happens to be the wealthiest county in the US. But Loudon was on everyone's radar earlier this week, when a massive global Amazon outage downed everything from crucial banking services to fun Snapchat streaks for millions. Data centers—dedicated spaces for computer systems that help power the internet and artificial intelligence—are essential to our global connectivity. But while they have proven to be a lucrative business— contributing billions to the local economy—some residents worry the cost comes at too high a price. Data centers take up 3% of the total land area of the county and 40% of its budget. Dan Diori, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, said the industry needed to do a better job communicating the up-sides of these centers, and listening to people's concerns. But some residents, like Barbara Day, say people shouldn't have to choose between the economy and quality of life.""These data centers are going up faster than we realized the implications of and then we're back-paddling to fix it,"" cybersecurity expert Thomas Hyslip said.Since the industry began booming rapidly earlier this century, regulations on the centers have been limited. Virginia's Governor, Glenn Youngkin, vetoed state legislation that would have regulated the centers earlier this year.",Positive

Harris said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.Part of the issue there was that it would—would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?""The issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.Harris has already ruled out running for governor in her home state, California, and the former prosecutor told the BBC she was ""not done"" with public service.",Positive

I am watching this very closely.""",Positive
