"Rowling dismisses Watson as 'ignorant' over trans rights row ""Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,"" Rowling writes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7012ryvyyo,"– JK Rowling has sent a stinging response to Emma Watson after the Harry Potter actress recently spoke about their relationship and a public disagreement over the issue of gender identity.Last week, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refuses to ""cancel her out"" despite their differences on the subject.But on Monday, the author responded by saying her own feelings towards her ""former friend"" had soured after she says Watson publicly poured ""petrol on the flames"" of the debate at the peak of threats against her.Rowling wrote on X: ""Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is."" Watson, 35, played Hermione Granger in the eight films based on Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.She and Daniel Radcliffe were among the stars who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author sparked a row by speaking out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.Rowling concluded: ""Adults can't expect to cozy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother."" Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public - but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.""Rowling went on to suggest that Watson was ""never likely to need"" to use the types of single-sex spaces she has campaigned against trans people having access to, such as changing rooms and public toilets.Rowling said it had been, however, ""hard to shake a certain protectiveness"" after knowing someone since they were 10. Watson's recent declaratons of love marked a ""change of tack I wasn't able to throw off the memory of children who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio.""Like other people who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio.Rowling concluded: ""Adults can't expect to cozy up to cozy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love.",Positive
"US shutdown looms after Trump and Democrats end meeting without a deal Democrats say there are still ""very large differences"" between the two sides, while Republicans have accused them of  ""not doing the right thing"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kn3n315lko,"– The US is hurtling towards a government shutdown on Tuesday night, and there appears to be little appetite on either side of the partisan divide to avoid it.A last-ditch meeting between President Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress made little progress. ""I think we're headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing,"" Vice President JD Vance told reporters after the meeting at the White House. Democrats don't see it that way.They believe healthcare is a winning issue for them, so they want the debate to be on whether millions of Americans will lose the ability to afford medical insurance.Republicans think they have the political high ground.The most recent government shutdown, during Trump's first term, lasted 35 days, setting a record as the longest in American history.Although the fight was over spending on the president's proposed US-Mexico border wall, it ended because federal air traffic controllers—who were working without pay— began staying home, threatening massive disruption to US air travel.Democrats may see a benefit to fighting Republicans, but will they be willing to stand aside as cherished federal programs and government services—including those for low-income Americans—are shuttered?""Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one - not to govern, but to scare,"" Schumer said.",Negative

"US considering supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles, Vance says Vance's comments come as Ukraine's deputy defence minister tells the BBC Western weapons could force Moscow to start peace talks.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6r1mg34yo,"– The US is considering a request by Ukraine for long-range Tomahawk missiles, US Vice-President JD Vance has said.However, Vance added President Donald Trump would be making ""the final determination"" on the matter.Kyiv has long been calling for its Western partners to provide it with weapons that could hit major Russian cities far from the front line, arguing that they would help Ukraine seriously weaken Russia's military industry and bring the war to an end.Trump is known to have been irritated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's surface willingness to discuss ending the war versus the reality of Moscow's persistent bombardments of Ukraine's cities.On Sunday, a massive 12-hour strike involving hundreds of drones and nearly 50 missiles left four people dead in Kyiv and at least 70 injured.Ukraine is hoping that better protection of its cities with air defense systems combined with long-range weapons able to hit Russian targets will help bring Moscow to the negotiating table.""If the cost of continuing the war for Moscow is too high, it will be forced to start peace talks,"" deputy defense minister Ivan Havryliuk told the BBC.The more drones and missiles are fired by Russia, the harder it is for Ukraine to intercept them.Earlier this month Moscow fired a record number of more than 800 drones and missiles—the highest since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",Negative
