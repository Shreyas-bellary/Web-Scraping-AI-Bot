Where peace stands in Ukraine after frantic diplomacy The Trump administration seems serious about reaching a deal despite all the apparent chaos around its efforts.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly0jjv2lg1o,"– Are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?After a frantic, often confusing few days of diplomacy, Donald Trump seems to think so.""We're getting very close to a deal,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.For his part, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, who had looked and sounded grim over the weekend, said there were now ""many prospects that can make the path to peace real."" But from the Russians, apart from some discontented mutterings about European involvement and unauthorised leaks, the response has been somewhat muted.The plan, whose references to Ukraine giving up territory and limiting the size of its military led some to describe it as a ""Russian wish list"", caused consternation in Kyiv and sent European diplomats scrambling to limit the perceived damage.The First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the latest version of the plan had been slimmed down to just 19 points, with the most contentious issues— territory and Ukraine's future relations with NATO—put off for Trump and Zelensky to decide.Despite talks in Abu Dhabi involving the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll (a new addition to Trump's Ukraine team), Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and Russian officials, Ushakov says the plan has still not been discussed in detail.With Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff due in Moscow next week and talk of Zelensky paying another visit to the White House, it seems the pace of diplomacy is not about to let up.",Positive

US transportation secretary wants more civility in air travel. Not everyone is on board Experts say a public service campaign is missing the mark as US airports brace for the busiest holiday season in years.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5m73e2l6do,"– Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is urging air travelers to dress better and be more civil—and it's touching a nerve at a time when many Americans consider air travel more frustrating than ever. Ahead of what's expected to be the busiest Thanksgiving travel season in 15 years, Duffy launched a campaign last week titled ""The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You"", in which he harkened back to the 1950s and 60s to call for a return to civility and class in air travel. But as air traffic controllers remain short-staffed and customers face frequent flight delays, both social media users and aviation experts say Duffy is missing the point. A video ad for the Department of Transportation's campaign juxtaposes old footage of smiling airport staff and orderly passengers with modern social media videos of people starting fights on planes, putting their bare feet up on seats and engaging in other disruptive behavior.",Negative

Soldiers seize power in Guinea-Bissau and detain the president,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0edww3qgq2o,"– Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of more than 2 million people.Its coastline has many uninhabited islands, making it ideal for drugs traffickers—with the UN dubbing it a ""narco-state"" as it has been a key transit point for cocaine coming from Latin America en route to Europe.The former Portuguese colony has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.The 53-year-old had wanted to make history as the country's only president to secure a second consecutive mandate in the last 30 years.He had initially said he would not seek a second term.The election results were expected on Thursday—both Embal and his closest rival Fernando Dias had claimed victory.
