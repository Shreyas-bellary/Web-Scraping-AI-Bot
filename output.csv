Russia's intensifying drone war is spreading fear and eroding Ukrainian morale Ukraine is in danger of being overwhelmed by deadly strikes as Russia sends in swarms of drones.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m8gn7grn2o,"– June saw the highest monthly civilian casualties in three years, with 232 people killed and over 1,300 injured.Many will have been killed or wounded in communities close to the front lines, but others have been killed in cities far away from the fighting.""The surge in long-range missile and drone strikes across the country has brought even more death and destruction to civilians far away from the frontline,"" says Danielle Bell, head of HRMMU.""If Ukraine doesn't find a solution for how to deal with these drones, we will face great problems during 2025,"" says former intelligence officer Ivan Stupak.""Some of these drones are trying to reach military objects - we have to understand it - but the rest, they are destroying apartments, falling into office buildings and causing lots of damage to citizens.""For all their increasing capability, the drones are not an especially sophisticated weapon.But they do represent yet another example of the vast gulf in resources between Russia and Ukraine.""When production of particular missiles became too complicated - too expensive, too many components, too many complicated supply routes—they concentrated on this particular type of drone and developed different modifications and improvements.""The more drones in a single attack, Kuzan says, the more Ukraine hard-pressed air defense units struggle to shoot them down.Other, straight lines show the paths of ballistic or cruise missiles: much fewer in number but the weapons Russia relies on to do the most damage. analysis by the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War shows an increase in Russia's drone and missile strikes in the two months following Donald Trump's inauguration in January. June saw a new monthly high of 5,429 drones, July has seen more than 2,000 in just the first nine days.",Negative
Why is Trump targeting Brazil - and will it backfire for Bolsonaro? The US president's threatened new tariffs are likely to have major political ramifications in the country.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk68drj57mo,"– A message from US President Donald Trump on Wednesday landed like a grenade in Brazil, bringing the relationship between the two countries to an all-time low.Trump pledged to impose tariffs on Brazil at a rate as high as 50%. He accused the country of ""attacks"" on US tech companies and of conducting a ""witch hunt"" against the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, a longstanding ally who is facing prosecution over his alleged role in a plot to overturn the 2022 Brazilian election.The move follows a fresh round of political sparring between Trump and the current Brazilian president, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.Trump had earlier threatened members of the BRICS group—of which Brazil is a part—with tariffs, accusing those countries of anti-American positions. Brazil is one of the relatively few countries that buys more from the US than it sells—a setup which theoretically suits Trump's trade agenda.The words used by Trump suggest that Bolsonaro has a political proximity to the American president that few Brazilian or Latin American politicians could dream of.Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging program of tariffs—or import taxes—since he returned to office in January.Some kind of assistance for Bolsonaro from Trump was already expected by Brazilian politicians—but not on this scale.Lula's government said it would reciprocate—probably meaning equal tariffs on American products.Trump had earlier threatened members of the BRICS group—of which Brazil is a part—with tariffs, accusing those countries of anti-American positions.",Negative
"Trump threatens 35% tariffs on Canadian goods Trump also threatened blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners, and said he will soon announce new tariffs on the EU.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg819n954mo,"– The US has imposed a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports, though there is a current exemption in place for goods that comply with a North American free trade agreement.It is unclear if the latest tariffs threat would apply to goods covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).Trump announced the latest levies on Canada on Thursday in a letter posted to social media and addressed to Prime Minister Mark Carney.Canada sells about three-quarters of its goods to the US, and is an auto manufacturing hub and a major supplier of metals, making the US tariffs especially damaging to those sectors.The US has already imposed a blanket 25% tariff on some Canadian goods, and the country is feeling the pain of the Trump administration's global steel, aluminium, and auto tariffs.Trump's letter said the 35% tariffs are separate to those sector-specific levies.""As you are aware, there will be no tariff if Canada, or companies within your country, decide to build or manufacture products within the United States,"" Trump stated.He also tied the tariffs to what he called ""Canada's failure"" to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, as well as Canada's existing levies on US dairy farmers and the trade deficit between the two countries.""If Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter.These Tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with Your Country,"" Trump said.Canada has been engaged in intense talk with the US in recent months to reach a new trade and security deal.",Negative

"In the country with the world's lowest birth rate, fertility clinics are booming Growing demand for IVF treatments is stoking some optimism in South Korea's demographic crisis.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20wg50l563o,"– South Korea continues to struggle with the world's lowest birth rates, fertility clinics are in growing demand - a bright spot in the country's demographic crisis.Between 2018 and 2022, the number of fertility treatments carried out in the country rose nearly 50% to 200,000.Last year, one in six babies in Seoul were born with the help of fertility treatment.But recently there is reason for cautious optimism: instead of another record low, South Korea's birth rate rose slightly to 0.75 in 2024—its first increase in nine years.""It's a small bump, but still a meaningful one,"" says Seulki Choi, a professor at the Korea Development Institute's School of Public Policy and Management.It is too early to tell whether this is the start of a much-needed reversal or just a blip.The country's birth rate remains far below the global average of 2.2.But many like Dr Choi are cautiously optimistic.""If this trend holds, it could signal a longer-term shift,"" says Dr Choi.The country has repeatedly broken its own record for having the world's lowest birth rate: 0.98 babies per woman in 2018, 0.84 in 2020 and 0.72 in 2023.If this trend continues, experts warn the population of 50 million could halve in 60 years.",Negative
"Asia is reeling from Trump's tariff salvo – is anyone winning? The US president has reset the tariffs clock again, leaving Asia's export-driven economies in limbo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5l2yy42eo,"– President Trump said he plans to raise blanket tariffs from 10% to up to 20% on most trade partners, dismissing concerns that further levies could push up inflation.""We're just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it's 20% or 15%. We'll work that out now,"" he told NBC News.Countries around the world have until 1 August to strike a deal with the US.But they are likely wondering about their chances given that Japan, a staunch ally that has been openly pursuing a deal, is still facing a steep levy.Trump's label for Tokyo moved from ""tough"" to ""spoiled"" as talks dragged on.And then this week, Japan joined a list of 23 nations that were sent tariff letters—14 of those are in Asia.Trump also said he plans to raise blanket tariffs from 10% to up to 20% on most trade partners, dismissing concerns that further levies could push up inflation.Japan has proven to be a tough negotiator and I think that has annoyed Trump,"" Mr Koll argued.",Negative
Six things Trump should know about Liberia after he praised leader's 'good English' Liberia was founded by freed slaves and the country has long-standing historical ties with the US.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y72w17vpwo,"– President Trump has praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai for speaking ""good English"" and asked him where he went to school. What Trump might have missed is that Liberia shares a unique and long-standing connection with the US. English is the country's official language and many Liberians speak with an American accent because of those historical ties to the US. Here are six things to know about the West African country: Liberia was founded by freed African-American slaves in 1822 before declaring independence in 1847. Former US President Abraham Lincoln officially declared Liberia's independence in 1862 but the country retained a lot of US heritage and it remained in the American ""sphere of influence"" during the colonial period. Ten of Liberia's 26 presidents were born in the US. Liberia produced Africa's first elected female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.She was elected in 2005, two years after the nation's bloody civil war ended, and served as president until 2018.",Negative

Original Birkin bag shatters record with $10.1m sale,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8zvexp42o,"– The original Birkin bag, which set the template for arguably the most coveted accessory in fashion history, has been bought for 8.6m (£7.4m; $10.1m), becoming the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction.The black leather bag was made for singer Jane Birkin in 1985 after she spilled her belongings while sitting next to the boss of luxury fashion house Herms on a flight.She asked why they didn't make bigger bags, so he sketched out the design for a new, more practical but still highly desirable item on the airplane's sick bag.The prototype he made was sold to a private collector from Japan at Sotheby's in Paris on Thursday, far surpassing the 439,000 (£378,000; $513,000) previous record sale.The original has some unique features, such as Birkin's initials on the front flap, a non-removable shoulder strap, the nail clippers she kept attached to the strap, and marks where she put stickers for causes she supported, such as Médecins du Monde and Unicef.Birin, who died in 2023 at the age of 76, owned the original bag for a decade and donated it to an auction to raise funds for an Aids charity in 1994.It was later bought by Catherine Benier, who has a luxury boutique in Paris, who owned it for 25 years before selling it on Thursday.Sotheby's said the previous record price for a handbag was set by a White Himalayaoticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28 in 2021.",Positive
Canadian premier accuses US lawmakers of 'trying to trivialise' wildfires,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9jrxvjpjo,"– A Canadian premier has accused a group of US lawmakers who demanded the country do more to tackle its wildfires of ""trying to trivialise"" a deadly situation.""I would challenge these ambulance chasers in the US Congress to go and do the same, and to hear how much the American firefighting heroes who are here love our province,"" Wab Kinew said on Thursday.He added: ""This is what turns people off politics. When you've got a group of congresspeople trying to trivialise and make hay out of a wildfire season where we've lost lives in our province.""There are 104 wildfires burning across Manitoba as of Thursday, according to data by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC), several of which are classified as out of control.Wildfires are not uncommon during the summer months in Canada, but have intensified in recent years.The hardest hit provinces this year are Manitoba and Saskatchewan, with both declaring states of emergency earlier in the season.A large blaze killed two people in Lac Du Bonnet in Manitoba's cottage country in mid-May.The impact of the wildfires has also been felt beyond Canada's borders and into the US, where smoke traveling south has prompted air quality advisories.In their letter to the Canadian ambassador, the US lawmakers said: ""Our constituents have been limited in their ability to go outside and safely breathe due to the dangerous air quality the wildfire smoke has created.""They urged Canadian officials to do more to prevent the blazes, including through improved forest management.The Canadian embassy has told the BBC that Canada takes wildfire prevention ""very seriously.""Wildfires are part of the natural cycle, and play an essential role in the regeneration of Canada's boreal forests, according to Canada's natural resources ministry.",Positive
