"Hamas returns four more bodies of hostages, Israeli military says Israel warns it will restrict aid convoys into Gaza because of delays returning the remaining bodies.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced60125zyqo,"– Hamas has returned the bodies of four more deceased hostages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said.The Red Cross retrieved the remains in coffins and handed them over to the Israeli military late on Tuesday night.The transfer came after Israel warned it would restrict aid into Gaza until Hamas returned the bodies of all 28 deceased hostages. The Palestinian armed group handed back 20 living and four deceased hostages on Monday. Israeli officials said they had decided to restrict aid and delay plans to open the Rafah border crossing with Egypt because Hamas had violated the ceasefire deal by failing to turn over bodies of hostages. Hamas says it has had difficulty locating the dead hostages' remains.A copy of the ceasefire agreement, published by Israeli media last week, appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions might not be able to locate all of the bodies within the original timeframe.The plan would see Gaza initially governed by a transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats overseen by the ""Board of Peace"", before power is eventually transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) once it has undergone reforms.While Hamas maintains that its fighters are working to ""restore security"" and ""eliminate lawlessness,"" many fear the group is using the chaos to settle scores with rivals and silence critics.",Negative
"Bowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peace Trump's Middle East visit was a victory lap - but peace does not emerge just because a president decides it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86118q6ego,"– President Trump's visit to Israel and Egypt was the victory lap he wanted.Anyone watching the speeches he made in Jerusalem and Sharm el-Sheikh could see a man luxuriating in his power - enjoying the applause in Israel's parliament, and in Egypt, basking in the fact that so many heads of state and government had flown in. Trump's message at Sharm was, in effect, that he had created a historical turning point.""All I've done all my life is deals. The greatest deals just sort of happen... That's what happened right here. And maybe this is going to be the greatest deal of them all,"" he said. The war in Gaza has become one of those, if as Trump has declared, it really is over.The next phase of the Trump 20-point plan requires an agreement filling in the gaps of the framework which declares that the Gaza Strip will be demilitarized, secured and governed by a committee including Palestinians.The deal was for a ceasefire and an exchange of hostages for prisoners. Only 24 hours after Israelis and Palestinians, for very different reasons, shared joy and relief that hostages, prisoners and detainees were home, cracks are appearing in the ceasefire.Hamas has, so far, returned only four of the bodies of the 28 hostages who were killed during their incarceration.Israel's patience is thin.",Positive
"US strikes another vessel off Venezuela coast, killing six President Trump said the vessel belonged to ""narcoterrorists"" and that it was ""trafficking narcotics."" US officials have not provided evidence to this claim.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg51625lmmgo,"– The US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to ""narcoterrorists"" and that it was ""trafficking narcotics.""This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September.In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defense.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers—for example killing 'enemy fighters' even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicols Maduro.",Negative

"D’Angelo, R&B Grammy-award winning singer, dies aged 51 D'Angelo, who died after a cancer diagnosis, leaves behind a ""legacy of extraordinarily moving music"", his family says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynv40ly4vo,"– Award-winning R&B and soul singer D'Angelo has died aged 51 after a cancer diagnosis, his family has said. In a statement, they wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Archer, left behind a ""legacy of extraordinarily moving music"" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world.”The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won D'Angelo four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",Positive
"Madagascar military says it has seized power as president moves to 'safe place' The military promises elections within two years, but President Rajoelina insists he is still in charge.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xjjdgl8vo,"– An elite military unit says it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests in the Indian Ocean island.Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years.He also suspended key democratic institutions, like the electoral commission.Gen Z protesters will be part of the changes because ""the movement was created in the streets so we have to respect their demands"", he added.Troops and protesters have been celebrating the apparent ousting of President Rajoelina, with thousands waving flags in the capital, Antananarivo.CAPSAT, or the Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar.The unit supported Rajoelina when he came into power in 2009, but joined the protesters on Saturday.

Rajoelina's whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a ""safe place"" following an alleged attempt on his life by ""military personnel and politicians.""The African Union has warned against soldiers ""meddling"" in Madagascar's political affairs and rejected ""any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government.""President Rajoelina, an entrepreneur and former DJ, was once seen as a fresh start for Madagascar.But he fell out of favor following allegations of cronyism and corruption, which he denied.",Positive

"Trump says US will not 'waste our time' helping Argentina if Milei loses Trump warns if Milei's coalition is defeated in this month elections, ""we are not going to be generous"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7n82gd7pvo,"– President Donald Trump has acknowledged that a $20bn (£15bn) US lifeline to help calm Argentina's currency crisis is an attempt to sway elections this month in the South American nation.Welcoming Argentina's libertarian leader Javier Milei to the White House, Trump warned that the US would not ""waste our time"" with helping Argentina if Milei's party did not prevail.Milei praised Trump for his peacemaking efforts and said the US president's policies would lead to ""prosperity.""Argentina's financial turmoil comes ahead of national midterm elections on 26 October, seen as a test of voters' desire to continue backing Milei's cost-cutting, free-market reform agenda.As Trump sat across the table from his Argentine counterpart on Tuesday, he said the not-so-quiet bit out loud.""The election is coming up very soon,"" he said.Trump added: ""Victory [for Milei] is very important.Your poll numbers I hear are pretty good.I think they will be better after this.And, you know, our approvals are somewhat subject to who wins the election.""A presidential election is not due in Argentina until 2027.But Trump said if ""a socialist wins"" then the US would feel ""a lot differently"" about supporting the South American nation.""This currency swap was, economically speaking, supposed to be a bit of a lifeline for Argentina's currency—the peso, which has been losing value for years.It seems the financial markets are unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will be enough to boost Milei's electoral chances.",Positive
Trump administration looks for ways to pay federal officers during shutdown,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp55kkk2wo,"– The Trump administration is looking for alternative ways to ensure federal law enforcement officers are paid as the government shutdown enters its third week. With Democrats and Republicans locked in a stalemate over the shutdown, officials in government are exploring alternative ways of paying for some key programs, including a food program for women and children. On Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use ""all available funds"" to get members of the military paid on 15 October, when they would have their pay withheld. While Trump provided no further details on where that money would be drawn from, an OMB spokesperson told the BBC that the funds would come from an amount previously allocated for defense research and development that is available for two years. With both US political parties continuing to blame each other for the shutdown, the Trump administration has said it is seeking new ways to ensure that some essential services continue.",Positive
"ChatGPT will soon allow erotica for verified adults, says OpenAI boss",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd2qv58yl5o,"– OpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to ""treat adult users like adults"", says its boss Sam Altman.In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way—""but only if you want it not because we are being careful with mental health issues.""We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,"" Mr Altman said.Altman said that OpenAI previously made ChatGPT ""pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues"".""In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and mitigate as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,"" he said.The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's recent introduction of two sexually explicit xAI to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.",Positive
