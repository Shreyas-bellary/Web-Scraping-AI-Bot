How Trump secured a Gaza breakthrough which eluded Biden Trump's unique style and his relationships with key players helped but there were also factors beyond his control.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3yke64vp6o,"– Israel's air strike against the Hamas negotiating team in Qatar seemed like yet another escalation that pushed the prospect of peace further away.The attack on 9 September violated the sovereignty of an American ally and risked expanding the conflict into a region-wide war.Diplomacy appeared to be in ruins.Instead it turned out to be a key moment that has led to a deal, announced by President Donald Trump, to release all remaining hostages.This is a goal that he, and President Joe Biden before him, had sought for nearly two years.It is just the first step towards a more durable peace, and the details of Hamas disarmament, Gaza governance and full Israeli withdrawal remain to be negotiated.Trump's unique style and crucial relationships with Israel and the Arab world appear to have contributed to this breakthrough.But if this agreement holds, it could be Trump's signature achievement of his second term—one that eluded Biden and his diplomatic team.Trump exhibited a degree of will and pressure on an Israeli prime minister that is virtually unprecedented, says Aaron David Miller of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Trump had given Israel a relatively free hand in Gaza. Eight months into Trump's second term, with Iran chastened, Hezbollah to its immediate north greatly diminished and Gaza in ruins, all its major strategy objectives had been accomplished.",Positive

James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or ""timesharing"" of the home. The indictment claims the property ""was not occupied or used"" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead ""used as a rental investment property"", which was being rented to a family of three.Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post.",Negative
Tech billionaires seem to be doom prepping. Should we all be worried?
