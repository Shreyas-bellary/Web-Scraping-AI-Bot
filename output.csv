Kindy parents told to pay thousands for kids' art - sparking uproar and a midnight heist The debt-ridden centre said the money would go towards paying overdue bills.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8ed2g95zlo,"– How much would you pay for your child's art?That's the question one Australian kindergarten posed to dozens of families this week when it asked them to stump up A$2,200 (£1,000; $1,400) for the pleasure of taking home a curated portfolio of their child's artwork.The folders included many a random blob and splodge, alongside happy snaps of the would-be Picassos making creations only a parent could love.Billed as a fundraiser, the debt-ridden center said the money from the portfolios would go towards whittling down a long list of overdue bills, including unpaid wages for educators.Craigslea Community Kindergarten and Preschool in Brisbane closed last month after funding was halted amid an investigation into claims about its governance.And its obscure request has sparked anger in Queensland, with the state's leader calling it ""emotional blackmail"", regulators staging an intervention, and one parent allegedly going to extreme lengths to steal back their child's collection of artworks in the middle of the night.The controversy has been months in the making—tensions between management and parents at the kindergarten center, about half an hour north of Brisbane, have been steadily brewing this year.It's a community-run center affiliated with one of the state's largest childcare providers, the Creche and Kindergarten Association (C&K) spokeswoman told the BBC in statement.""I never saw any Picassos come home, that's for sure. But they mean something to you,"" David Crisafulli said of his own kids' early crafts, on the BBC's Today program.",Positive
China makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissions It is China's first firm goal to reduce emissions but falls well short of what is needed to meet global targets.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y159190go,"– China, the world's biggest source of planet-warming gases, has for the first time committed to an absolute target to cut its emissions. In a video statement to the UN in New York, President Xi Jinping said that China would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 7-10% by 2035, while ""striving to do better.""The announcement comes at a time the US is rolling back on its commitments, with President Trump on Tuesday calling climate change a ""con job.""China's new target does fall short of what would be needed to meet international climate goals.""Anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.But China's new target does fall short of what needs to be done to meet climate targets and what countries are planning.Earlier this week, a report by the Stockholm Environment Institute warned that governments around the world are collectively planning to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be in line with keeping to 1.5C.China was responsible for more than a quarter of planet-warming emissions in 2023, at almost 14bn tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent.A 10% reduction in China's emissions would equate to 1.4bn tonnes a year, which is nearly four times the UK's total annual emissions.But China's new target does fall short of what would be needed to meet international climate goals.""Even for those with tempered expectations, what's presented today still falls short,"" said Yao Zhe, global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia.",Positive
