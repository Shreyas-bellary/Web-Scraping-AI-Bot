​​What is inside the GHF aid box being distributed in Gaza BBC Verify examines the foods handed out to Gazans - and their nutritional value is questioned by some experts.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd787er1qz4o,"– More than two million Palestinians in Gaza are facing a starvation crisis, with deaths from malnutrition rising by the day, according to the United Nations.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a group backed by Israel and the US, has been operating in Gaza since late May.It says that it has distributed 91 million meals, primarily in the form of food boxes.While the BBC has been unable to see these boxes first-hand since Israel has blocked international journalists from entering Gaza, BBC Verify has examined photos and other information shared by the GHF and spoken to aid experts who have raised concerns about their nutritional value.Two pictures posted on X show mostly dried food items that require water and fuel to cook, including pasta, chickpeas, lentils, and wheat flour. Also included is cooking oil, salt and tahini, or sesame paste.The GHF has said these boxes also contain some ready-to-eat food, like halva bars—a popular snack made from blending tahini or sesame paste and sugar.An international aid development professor from the London School of Economics analysed the list provided by the GHF to BBC Verify and said that while it could deliver sufficient calories needed to survive, it had ""serious weaknesses"".""In essence, this basket provides a full stomach but an empty diet,"" Prof Stuart Gordon said.This (is) very much a 'first aid' food basket, designed to stop the haemorrhaging effect that is acute hunger.""A diet like this over weeks would lead to 'hidden hunger', increasing the risk of diseases like anaemia and scurvy' he said.",Positive
"World's thirst for matcha dries up global supplies Surging demand, smaller tea crops due to heatwaves and US tariffs on Japan are pushing up matcha prices.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq7w1n00xeo,"– The ""Matcha Tok"" hashtag has clocked up tens of millions of views.Matcha's growing popularity is also linked to Japan's post-pandemic tourism boom, with the country's weak currency making it an attractive destination as well as boosting demand for Japanese goods.In the midst of the hype, demand for the powder is soaring. US-based tea importer Lauren Purvis tells the BBC her customers are seeing what was once a month's supply of matcha running out in days.""Some cafes are even asking for a kilo a day.They're desperate to keep up,"" says Ms Purvis, who runs Mizuba Tea Co.But that surging demand, combined with smaller tea crops due to heatwaves and US tariffs on Japan, is also pushing up matcha prices.The Global Japanese Tea Association is encouraging people to use lower-grade matcha from later harvests, which is more abundant and better-suited for cooking.It also says matcha prices are likely to rise further due to tariffs the US is imposing on Japan.The leaves are harvested, dried and ground into powder using stone mills, which can produce just 40g (1.4oz) of matcha an hour.But in recent months growers have struggled, as record-breaking heatwaves have hit crops.Matcha production nearly tripled between 2010 and 2023, according to Japan's agricultural ministry.It also says green tea exports, including matcha, also rose 25% last year to 36.4bn yen (£180m; $250m.)",Positive
"Meeting over between US official and Ghislane  Maxwell, who will 'welcome any relief', lawyer says When asked about giving Maxwell clemency, the president said he was allowed to do so, but had ""not thought"" about it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd2de8zz5go,"– A second day of meetings between a senior US justice department official and Jeffrey Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell has concluded with ""no asks and no promises"", her lawyer says.This is not a situation where we are asking for anything in return for testimony or anything like that,"" Maxwell's attorney David Markus said on Friday.Mr Markus told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the two met for three hours on Friday and that Maxwell answered every question ""honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability"".""She answered every one of them,"" he said earlier.Mr Markus previously told reporters he was ""thankful"" that Blanche had come to ask Maxwell questions.The official pointed to Epstein files disclosed months earlier by the justice department that had included Trump.Being named in the documents is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case.House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell - who for years helped Epstein groom and sexually abuse girls - cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony.Maxwell's lawyer, Markus, previously told the BBC the concerns were ""unfounded"" and that if she chose to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, ""she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would.""Last week, the justice department asked a federal judge to release years-old grand jury testimony related to Epstein.",Positive

"Tee time with Trump - striking balls and deals over 18 holes For some US presidents, golf was a break from work - but for Trump, visiting Scotland this weekend, it is anything but.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2y4w47deo,"– President Trump is in Scotland this weekend for the opening of a new Trump course near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. For presidents like Barack Obama and George W Bush, golf seemed to serve as a diversion from the burdens of office. For the current president, however, golf is a business venture, a networking opportunity and—as Mulvaney recounts—a fiercely competitive undertaking. Trump, a real-estate developer turned politician, has played golf since his college days and bought his first golf property, Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach Florida, in 1999. He said he was taking in the scenery on the second hole, when one of the other players in his foursome told him that Trump had asked if he could ""get a move on"".""He was more focused, head down, motoring on ahead of us,"" Brown said. Mulvaney, who worked in Trump's White House for three years in his first term, says he played golf with, or in the group just behind, the president around 40 times and never beat the man 21 years his elder.",Positive
Cambodia calls for immediate ceasefire with Thailand Thailand is yet to comment on the truce proposal after two days of fighting left at least 16 dead.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9x99n79v8o,"– Cambodia has called for an ""immediate"" ceasefire with Thailand, after two days of cross-border fighting between the two South East Asian neighbors.The dispute between the two countries dates back to more than 100 years ago, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.At least 16 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in both countries, who accuse each other of firing the first shots on Thursday. Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai on Friday warned that the clashes could ""move towards war.""He said the fighting now included heavy weapons and had spread to 12 locations along the border.Thailand also accused Cambodia of firing into civilian areas and evacuated all villages deemed to be within the radius of its rockets.Cambodia says Thai soldiers initiated the conflict when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border.The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash, plunging bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chairs the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), had earlier offered to facilitate talks between the two countries.The US also called for an ""immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians, and a peaceful resolution of the conflict.""",Negative
"School-leavers losing their lives for Russia in Putin's war with Ukraine Russia has promised that no 18-year-olds will be sent to fight in Ukraine, but the BBC finds many have already been killed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9xkg7dmd5o,"– Vladimir Putin has repeatedly promised that no 18-year-olds called up to serve Russia will be sent to fight in Ukraine, but a BBC Russian investigation has found at least 245 soldiers of that age have been killed there in the past two years.New government rules mean teenagers fresh out of school have been able to bypass military service and go straight into the regular army as contract soldiers.They may make up only a fraction of Russian losses, but cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda have made signing up an attractive choice.Alexander Petlinsky enlisted two weeks after his 18th birthday.He was killed in Ukraine just 20 days later: one of hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine which has also claimed the lives of at least 13,500 Ukrainian civilians since Putin launched the invasion in February 2022. Military experts estimate that makes up 45-65% of the real death toll, which would equate to 185,143 to 267,500 dead.When Alexander Petlinksy turned 18 on 31 January, the first thing he did was to apply to take a year out of college so he could sign a contract with the Defense Ministry.Although he had wanted to become a doctor, he also dreamed of going to fight in Ukraine.His family have not ruled out that it was the police who ""persuaded"" him.The day before he left he called his mother, Anna, to say he was about to leave.The BBC's figures are based on open-source information and because not every death is publicly reported, the real losses are bound to be higher.Vladimir Putin has repeatedly promised that no 18-year-olds called up to serve Russia will be sent to fight in Ukraine, but the BBC investigation has found at least 245 soldiers of that age have been killed there in the past two years.",Negative
Trump praises PM Starmer as he arrives in Scotland for four-day trip,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8g8w431wyo,"– President Trump's visit to Scotland was in the ""national interest.""Speaking during a press conference at Prestwick Airport, Trump said European countries need to ""get your act together"" on migration, and ""stop the windmills.""He said: ""I say two things to Europe: Stop the windmills. You're ruining your countries. I really mean it, it's so sad.""You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds, and if they're stuck in the ocean, ruining your oceans.""Stop the windmills, and also, I mean, there's a couple of things I could say, but on immigration, you'd better get your act together or you're not going to have Europe anymore.""Trump is expected to meet Starmer and Swinney on Monday while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed on X that she will meet the president on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations.Trump will travel back to the US on Tuesday and is due to return to the UK for an official state visit in September.",Negative
Taiwan holds controversial vote targeting 'pro-China' lawmakers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8185e19l4o,"– Thousands of Taiwanese are heading to the polls in an unprecedented and controversial vote aimed at ousting lawmakers accused of being too close to China.More than 30 lawmakers have been targeted in the ""dabamian"", or Great Recall vote, initiated by a civic movement.The vote has the potential to alter the balance of power in Taiwan, which has seen months of political deadlock between the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government and the legislature dominated by the opposition Kuomintang and its allies.The party has denied this, but suspicion grew when a group of Kuomintang lawmakers visited China last year and were welcomed by top-ranking Chinese Communist Party official Wang Huning.Civic groups in the Bluebird movement launched petitions to oust various Kuomintang lawmakers, while Kuomintang supporters retaliated by doing the same to some DPP lawmakers.So far, petitions for 31 lawmakers' seats have received enough preliminary support to proceed with a final recall vote.All these seats are held by the Kuomintang - and if enough are successfully recalled, it could mean the DPP eventually gains the majority in the legislature.",Positive
