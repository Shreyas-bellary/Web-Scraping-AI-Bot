"Why Oval Office map has played crucial role in Trump's view of Ukraine war Ukraine's leader has taken issue with the American map, because of the amount of control it gives Russia.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeynw8jppdo,"– Russia has occupied a fifth of Ukrainian territory—and a big map showing the area shaded in red was put up in the Oval Office as if to emphasise that point for President Donald Trump's talks with Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday.""I assume you've all seen the map,"" Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. ""A big chunk of territory is taken and that territory has been taken.""The message from the White House to Ukraine is unmistakable.That land has gone and it is time to consider a territorial compromise with Vladimir Putin or, as some have termed it, land swaps.Zelensky's team had brought their own map to the meeting and the Ukrainian leader said later he had been ""fighting with what is on that map"" during his conversation with Trump, regarding ""who controls what—not by hearsay, but in reality.""Although he felt he had made some headway on correcting any false impressions, by Tuesday Trump's view was the same.It was clear, he said, that Russia's force was ""so clearly much more powerful, and you know, it's not like they've stopped.""Asked what the feeling was like in the room with European leaders regarding land swaps he said: ""Now they're talking about Donbas, but Donbas right now is... 79% owned and controlled by Russia.""",Positive
"Two summits later, Trump still faces tough obstacles in quest for peace in Ukraine Meetings in Alaska and Washington were high on pomp and low on breakthroughs, but there were two potentially significant developments.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c776edpr10eo,"– Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska for a summit that was high on pomp and pageantry and low on diplomatic breakthroughs in the push to end the Russia-Ukraine war.On Monday, six European leaders rushed to Washington DC to meet with Trump and assess the consequences of that Putin meeting.The simple fact that yesterday's meetings between Trump and Zelensky, and the larger gathering of European leaders, was conducted in a friendly, co-operative fashion is itself notable given Zelensky's acrimonious White House visit in February and the sometimes contentious relations Trump has had with his European counterparts.Trump seemed to enjoy being the gracious host both in Alaska and at the White House, and his comments suggest he views ending the war in Ukraine as a key to cementing his legacy.""If I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons,"" he said in a Tuesday television interview.But the path to heaven is narrow, as the saying goes, and there are still numerous obstacles to ending the war in Ukraine, not the least of which is that it is still not clear that Putin wants the war to end when he is making grinding progress on the battlefield.The Europeans' hastily arranged trip to Washington DC was designed to sandwich Putin to limit his ability to influence Trump's thinking.Besides the key players, there is another voice factoring into Trump's decision making process - his political base that takes his ""America first"", non-interventionist rhetoric to heart.Even if Putin proves to be a reliable negotiating partner—a big if—Trump himself can be a mercurial ally.",Negative

But that's exactly what happened to Ghislaine Maxwell on Friday in Nebraska.

The reptile was retrieved by the officer and buckled into the back of a police car.",Negative

"Can Trump really ban mail-in voting? Trump, who has said that ""mail-in ballots are corrupt"" and susceptible to voter fraud, now wants to lead a movement to get rid of it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crev0n5vlp0o,"– President Donald Trump plans to use his office to try to get rid of mail-in ballots ahead of the 2026 elections for the House of Representatives and Senate.""An executive order is being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots because they're corrupt,"" he said in a social media post this week. During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, Trump also showed a political motivation, saying that mail-in voting is ""the only way"" Democrats ""can get elected.""Mail-in ballots, in part, helped Trump secure his 2024 victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. But he has long claimed, without proof, that he lost the 2020 election due to voter fraud perpetrated through mail-in ballots and voting machines.Mail-in voting allows voters to cast their ballots at home and then send them in to be counted, instead of going in person to cast a ballot at a polling place. Eight states and Washington, DC, allow all elections to be conducted entirely by mail: California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington state.Of those, only two - Nevada and Utah - went to Trump in 2024.Trump, though, posted on social media that under the law the states ""are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes.""The Constitution does not give the President any control over federal elections,"" Hasen wrote.",Negative
"Israel demands release of all Gaza hostages, casting doubt on ceasefire proposal It comes a day after Hamas said it accepted a proposal for a 60-day truce, during which around half of the 50 hostages would be freed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeynvp409vo,"– Israel is demanding the release of all 50 hostages held in Gaza, an Israeli official has said, casting doubt on whether it will accept a new proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that Hamas agreed to on Monday.The proposal, put forward by Qatar and Egypt, would see the release of around half the hostages and is ""almost identical"" to a US proposal Israel had previously accepted, according to Qatar.Israel has not explicitly rejected it - but Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told the BBC that it is not interested in ""partial deals.""Things have changed now.The prime minister has laid out a plan for the future of Gaza,"" Mencer said.Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Al-Araby TV that they had not sought any amendments to the proposal, which he described as ""a partial deal leading to a comprehensive deal.""Israel believes that only 20 of the 50 hostages are still alive after 22 months of war.Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Israel must not accept a partial deal ""that abandons half of the hostages and that could lead to the suspension of the war in defeat"".""It is forbidden to surrender and give a lifeline to the enemy,"" he added.On Saturday night, Prime Minister Netanyahu's office put out a similar statement saying that Israel would only ""agree to a deal on condition that all the hostages are released in one go"" and that the conditions for ending the war included the disarming of Hamas, the demilitarization of Gaza, Israeli control of the Gaza perimeter, and the installation of non-Hamas and non-Palestinian Authority governance.Israel accepted the Witkoff plan, but Hamas rejected it, partly because it did not include a guarantee that the temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent one.",Negative
How many wars has President Trump really ended? US President Donald Trump claims to have ended seven wars - is that true?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3599gx4qo,"– President Trump has been highlighting his track record in peace negotiations since starting his second term in office.Speaking at the White House on 18 August, where he was pressed by European leaders to push for a ceasefire, he claimed: ""I've ended six wars... all of these deals I made without even the mention of the word 'ceasefire'.""The following day the number he cited had risen to ""seven wars.""The Trump administration says a Nobel Peace Prize is ""well past time"" for the ""peacemaker-in-chief"", and has listed the ""wars"" he has supposedly ended.Some lasted just days - although they were the result of long-standing tensions - and it is unclear whether some of the peace deals will last.On 23 June, Trump posted: ""Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World.""I think he gets good credit here - the Oval Office signing ceremony may have pushed the parties to peace,"" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.""So what we have is more of a de facto ceasefire than an end to war, but I'd give him some credit, as the weakening of Iran by Israel - with US help - has been strategically significant."" Tensions between these two nuclear-armed countries have existed for years, but in May hostilities broke out following an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.On 7 August, Thailand and Cambodia reached an agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their shared border.What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?""There's still fighting between Congo and Rwanda - so that ceasefire has never really held,"" says Margaret MacMillan, a professor of history who taught at the University of Oxford.",Negative
"US military vets are helping Afghans fight deportation Afghan refugees in the US say they fear what would happen if they return to their country, which is now controlled by the Taliban.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq68zq24vg5o,"– Ten veterans showed up for his hearing— unarmed, but dressed in hats and shirts to signify their military credentials as a ""show of force"", said Shawn VanDiver, a US Navy vet who founded 'Battle Buddies' to support Afghan refugees facing deportation.""Masked agents of the federal government are snatching up our friends, people who took life in our name and have done nothing wrong,"" he said.Approximately 200,000 Afghans relocated to the US after Kabul fell to the Taliban in August 2021 as the US left the country in chaos after two decades fighting the war on terror.But since the Trump administration has terminated many of the programs which protected them from deportation, Afghans now fear they will be deported and returned to their home country, which is now controlled by the Taliban.Mr VanDiver, who also founded #AfghanEvac in 2021 to help allies escape the Taliban when the US withdrew, said US military veterans owe it to their wartime allies to try and protect them from being swept up in President Trump's immigration raids.""It's short sighted to think we can do this and not lose our credibility,"" said Monique Labarre, a US Army veteran who showed up for Abdul's hearing.Mr VanDiver told his fellow Battle Buddies outside court before Abdul's hearing, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.If somebody does fight ICE, capture it on video.Mr Naser has been in detention since that day, fighting for political asylum from behind bars.",Negative
Air Canada to resume flights after pay deal struck with union,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewyzg8rpxpo,"– Flight crew at Air Canada have ended a dispute with the airline which had grounded flights and stranded thousands of passengers since Saturday.A tentative agreement was announced by the union representing flight attendants and confirmed by the airline, which said flights will resume later on Tuesday.The deal has not been disclosed in full, though the union said it achieves ""transformational change"" for workers and the industry.The agreement will now be presented to members to be ratified.The breakthrough came nine hours after talks began with the help of an approved mediator appointed by the government.""Unpaid work is over,"" said the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in a statement early on Tuesday, calling the negotiations a ""historic fight"" for the industry.The union also advised its members to ""fully co-operate with resumption of operations.""The nearly four-day strike has impacted more than 500,000 passengers, Air Canada has said.Air Canada said the first flights would restart on Tuesday evening, but it may take days to return to a full service because aircraft and crew are out of position.The union also rejected an order by the Canadian government to enter binding arbitration and return to work over the weekend, accusing it of ""caving to corporate pressure.""The union also rejected an order by the Canadian Industrial Relations Board, which deemed the strike ""unlawful"" in a ruling on Monday.Following news of a tentative deal, Air Canada said the first flights would restart on Tuesday evening, but it may take days to return to a full service because aircraft and crew are out of position.",Negative
