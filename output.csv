"Trump's pact to defend Qatar could shake up or shore up a fragile region The order vows to use the US military, if necessary, to defend the tiny energy-rich nation almost mirrors aspects of a Nato alliance.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203yldq44wo,"– President Trump this week signed an executive order vowing to use all measures—including the US military—to defend the Gulf state of Qatar. The text says Washington will view any armed attack on the tiny energy-rich nation as a threat to the Unites States itself and will ""take all lawful and appropriate measures—including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military—to defend the interests of the United States and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability."" The order amounts to an extraordinary security pact between America and a key Arab ally, almost mirroring aspects of a Nato alliance. It's all the more remarkable given how Qatar has transitioned in just a few years from being the focus of an economic and diplomatic boycott by its neighbors to now becoming the Middle East's ambassadorial crossroads—most recently in its role as mediator between Israel and Hamas. Trump's move to enshrine US protection for Qatar follows the rage expressed by the ruling Al Thani family last month after Israeli airstrikes on their soil targeted Hamas leaders, leaving several lower-level members of the group dead along with a Qatari security official. Gulf analysts say Trump's guarantee is important to shore up a jittery region, shaken by Israel's escalating use of force beyond its borders alongside wider concerns about the reliability of the US security umbrella in the Gulf.",Positive
