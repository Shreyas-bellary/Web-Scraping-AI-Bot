CIA deployment gives Trump no 'limitations' on Venezuela action Previous presidential findings have seen the US arm rebels and conduct lethal strikes around the globe.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c751l7gqx1no,"– President Trump has acknowledged that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela—a highly unusual admission of what is normally a highly sensitive and tightly guarded state secret. The authorisation—more typically known as a presidential finding—could give the agency broad leeway to conduct operations in the region, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader operations aimed at destabilising or toppling the regime of Nicols Maduro. Previous presidential findings have ultimately led to drone strikes on militants overseas, money and weapons funnelled to insurgencies, and even efforts at full regime change. According to US law, presidents may authorise covert actions if they determine that these operations are ""necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives...[and] important to the national security of the United States."" It remains unclear whether the CIA is already conducting covert actions in Venezuela, is planning to, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies.",Negative
The 'shadow army' helping Uganda's long-serving president keep an iron grip on power Analysts say the unit has become so influential that it rivals the power of the regular army.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg33ke2d6do,"– Toting sub-machine guns and sometimes wearing masks as they drive along the streets of Uganda, members of an elite military unit are increasingly viewed as a private army to keep 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni in power—along with his ever-growing family dynasty.Museveni has led Uganda since 1986, when his rebel forces marched into the capital, Kampala. He has since won four elections—all marred by allegations of violence and rigging.But the SFC, which for years was commanded by Museveni's son Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has been accused by government critics of abducting, torturing and killing opposition activists all year round, not just during elections.The unit now known as the SFC was established when Museveni first took office, and has a motto stating ""there is no substitute for loyalty"".""It's like a shadow army within the army which is only answerable to the president and his son.Its rise and influence is causing resentment among senior generals,"" one military source told the BBC.Analysts say the unit has become so influential that it rivals the power of the regular army, which still has commanders who fought in the guerrilla war that brought Museveni and his National Resistance Movement (NRM) to power.Museveni is seeking re-election next year and the opposition fears that the Special Forces Command (SFC) could be used to prevent it from campaigning, as it says was the case in 2021.Gen Kainerugaba has also been contemptuous of some long-serving generals, calling one a ""buffoon.""They go through specialized training.Although his father promoted him to chief of the defense forces in March last year, Gen Kainerugaba is said to have maintained de facto control over the SFC, with its current commander, Maj Gen David Mugisha, reporting to him.Gen Kainerugaba mostly operates from the unit's headquarters—in Entebbe, about 21 miles south of the capital, Kampala.",Negative

Bolton said in a statement that he looked forward to defending his ""lawful conduct"" in court as he accused Trump of seeking ""retribution against me"".""Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,"" Bolton said.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges stemmed from diary entries kept by his client over his 45-year career in public service.The US Department of Justice then opened an investigation into whether Bolton had mishandled classified information by disclosing certain information in the book. Asked about the indictment on Thursday at the White House, Trump said he did not know about it, but added that Bolton was ""a bad guy."" Bolton, who served as George W Bush's UN ambassador, was among former officials critical of Trump who had their Secret Service protection stripped in January.He is the third Trump critic to be criminally charged since September.",Negative
