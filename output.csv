"Starmer set to announce UK recognition of Palestinian state on Sunday A host of countries, including France and Canada, are expected to do the same when world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly next week.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce800enrglzo,"– The UK is expected to announce the country's recognition of a Palestinian state in a statement on Sunday afternoon.The move comes after the prime minister said in July the UK would shift its position in September unless Israel met conditions including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and committing to a long-term sustainable peace deal that delivers a two-state solution.It represents a major change in British foreign policy after successive governments said recognition should come as part of a peace process and at a time of maximum impact.The move has drawn fierce criticism from the Israeli government, hostage families, and some Conservatives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously said such a move ""rewards terror.""However, UK ministers argue there was a moral responsibility to act to keep the hope of a long-term peace deal alive.Palestine is currently recognized by around 75% of the UN's 193 member states, but has no internationally agreed boundaries, no capital, and no army—making recognition largely symbolic.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.",Positive

The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules—or go home."" The new restrictions were set out in a briefing note sent to members of the press, which they will be required to sign in order to maintain their Pentagon press credentials.It asks signatories to acknowledge that determinations on press credentials for the building ""may be based on the unauthorised access, attempted unauthorised access, or unauthorized disclosure"" of classified national security information, or information designated as controlled unclassified information.
