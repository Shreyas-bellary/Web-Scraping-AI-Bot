Trump abandons attack mode as Minneapolis shooting backlash grows The White House has shifted how it talks about Alex Pretti's killing as more Republicans express concern over the deadly encounter.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn9q1wp0yo,"– The Trump administration has quickly abandoned its familiar ""deny and attack"" playbook after initially using it when federal agents shot dead Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday morning.Within 24 hours, as various videos of the shooting circulated online, it became clear that the White House was out of step with public opinion and what Americans could see with their own eyes.Since then, the administration—and the president himself—have changed tack, blaming Democrats for what happened and focusing less on the actions of the American nurse who was killed.Republicans in Washington DC and elsewhere have expressed growing unease with how the administration was handling the situation.The footage shows Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone and helping a woman who is pushed over before both are pepper-sprayed.DHS says Pretti had a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two magazines of ammunition.Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit.The initial administration response to Pretti's death was straightforward.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Pretti wished to ""inflict harm"" and was ""brandishing"" a weapon.Senior presidential adviser Stephen Miller called Pretti a ""would-be assassin.""Multiple videos of Saturday's deadly encounter contradict many of the administration's initial claims.The footage shows Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone and helping a woman who is pushed over before both are pepper-sprayed.Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit.

"China has purged its highest-ranked military general. Why? Zhang Youxia had been seen as a close ally of China's leader, Xi Jinping.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d0l0g8yz5o,"– The purging of the generals may be about corruption, but it may also be about power politics, given how these purges have panned out in the past.China definitely had a corruption problem when Xi Jinping came to power, but its leader has also been accused of using his anti-corruption drive, deploying the Party's feared discipline inspection teams, to take out would-be political rivals or those in government ranks showing anything short of full loyalty to him.The PLA Daily editorial was already speaking of Zhang and Liu as if they were guilty, saying they had ""seriously betrayed the trust and expectations of the Communist Party's Central Committee"" as well as ""trampling on and undermining the Central Military Commission.""The targeting of the generals may be about corruption, but it may also be about power politics, given how these purges have panned out in the past.China definitely had a corruption problem when Xi Jinping came to power, but its leader has also been accused of using his anti-corruption drive, deploying the Party's feared discipline inspection teams, to take out would-be political rivals or those in government ranks showing anything short of full loyalty to him.The purging of the most senior generals also brings scrutiny on the next layer of officers who may be wondering who is next?Given the fate of those above they also may not welcome promotion into the deadly zone where Xi's anti-corruption spotlight can be trained on you at any time.Analysts will be weighing up just how much these removals have hampered such a possibility - though some think it will have little impact on curbing Beijing's turmoil.",Negative

What to expect from the Bafta nominations,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrz09lx91vo,"– Timothée Chalamet, Emma Stone, Jessie Buckley and Jacob Elordi are among the actors who could secure Bafta Film Award nominations, which are announced later.Bafta is the final major organization to reveal its shortlists in this year's film awards season, following the announcement of the Oscar nominations last week.Hamnet, Sinners and One Battle After Another are expected to lead the field, but KPop Demon Hunters will miss out due to eligibility rules.Many of the films in contention are the same as the Oscars, but there will be more UK representation at the Baftas, which has dedicated to recognizing British talent.Perhaps the most notable omission, however, is KPop Demon Hunters—the Netflix smash that was the biggest viral film hit of last year.It is the frontrunner in the animated and original song categories at the Oscars, but it's ineligible at the Baftas as it opened straight to Netflix in the UK without a preceding viral film hit.British and Irish actors often perform better on their own soil, plus there are categories dedicated to outstanding British debut and outstanding British film, in addition to best overall film.The other films longlisted for outstanding British film include Pillion, a superb film about two men in a BDSM relationship, and terrific screen adaptation of H is for Hawk, about a woman who buys and trains a goshawk while grieving her father's death.",Positive
Menopause linked to Alzheimer's-like brain changes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qpp1g5ylvo,"– The menopause is linked to changes in the brain similar to those seen in Alzheimer's, according to a large UK study.The loss of gray matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain why women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate.The findings come from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. In the study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the grey matter loss. Prof Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: ""The brain regions where we saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.""Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line.While not the whole story, it may help explain why we see almost twice as many cases of dementia in women than in men.""The brain changes occurred in:a area which has a major role in learning and memory - the hippocampusa region essential for forming memories and spatial navigation - the entorhinal cortexa part which helps with attention and regulating emotions - the anterior cingulate cortexWhite matter and gray matter are both essential parts of the brain and spinal cord.",Neutral
