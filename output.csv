Why Donetsk matters so much for Ukraine's defences For Ukraine to lose western Donetsk would mean the fall of a bulwark against any future Russian advance.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6yd4d5zj6o,"– Vladimir Putin reportedly wants to freeze the war in Ukraine along its current front line in return for the surrender of the rest of Donetsk region.""The reality is these resources likely will not be able to be accessed for arguably a decade at least because of the [land] mines...""

Democratic-led states are pushing to redraw their own maps to offset the Texas ones. President Donald Trump backed redrawing the maps to safeguard a Republican majority in the US House. Wednesday's vote in Texas followed a dramatic showdown as Democrats fled across state lines to deny Republicans the quorum necessary in the state legislative body to take a vote.Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, ordered their absent Democrats' arrest, and some of them said law enforcement had monitored their homes while they were gone.Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows ordered the statehouse chamber doors to be locked on Monday.He also said Democrats would be ""released into the custody"" of a designated police officer to ensure they returned to the statehouse on Wednesday for the redistricting vote.Democrats and civil rights groups have said the new maps will dilute voting power from minorities, which would violate federal law, and have threatened to sue.After the vote on Wednesday, California Gov Gavin Newsom wrote on X: ""It's on, Texas.""",Positive

Tensions between these two nuclear-armed countries have existed for years, but in May hostilities broke out following an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir.On 7 August, Thailand and Cambodia reached an agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their shared border.",Negative

A fierce war of words keeps Thailand and Cambodia on edge The two sides are waging an information war to win international sympathy and shore up support at home.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrx53zeg4o,"– The century-old border dispute dramatically escalated with a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand on the morning of 24 July, followed by Thai air strikes.Since then an army of Cambodian social media warriors, backed by state-controlled English language media channels, have unleashed a flood of allegations and inflammatory reports, many of which turned out to be false.The guns along the forested Thai-Cambodian border have been silent for three weeks now. But a fierce war of words is still being waged by both countries, as they seek to win international sympathy and shore up public support at home.The perception is that Cambodia has appeared more agile, more assertive and more media savvy,"" said Clare Patchimanon, speaking on the Thai Public Broadcasting System podcast Media Pulse.It is no secret that the elected Thai government, centered on the Pheu Thai party of controversial billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, has an uneasy relationship with the Thai military.That was made much worse in June when Hun Sen, the former Cambodian leader and an old friend of Thaksin's, decided to leak a private phone conversation he had with Thaksin's daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.From the start Hun Sen posted constantly, in Khmer and English, on his Facebook page, taunting the Thai government, along with photos that showed him in army uniform or poring over military maps.The official reason Thailand gives for rejecting ICJ involvement is that like many other countries it does not recognize ICJ jurisdiction.But Cambodia wants to internationalise the dispute.It was the first to refer the escalating conflict to the UN Security Council last month.",Negative
"Saving China's finless porpoise from the brink of extinction Scientists are racing to protect what some view as ""the most important animal"" in the Yangtze.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3jy7el90po,"– It was in 2002 that the last known baiji died, 22 years after researchers at the Institute started caring for it. A year later, the last known paddle fish—a type of ray-finned fish which can grow to more than 3 meters—was accidentally caught by fishermen and, despite being radio tagged and released, disappeared.The goal now is to stop the Yangtze finless river porpoise—1,200 of which remain in the wild, according to current estimates—from suffering the same fate.At the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan, just 5km (3.1 miles) from the banks of the river, the preserved bodies of the now-extinct river dolphin (baiji in Chinese) and paddle fish sit silently behind panes of glass.""Now that those have become extinct, we're going to save the Yangtze river porpoise,"" Professor Wang Xi tells the BBC.The construction of the main part of Three Gorges Dam in 2006 didn't directly impact the finless porpoise, which don't have to go upstream to spawn, although it did affect the fish they eat.Chinese scientists think that the sound from ships may have contributed to the demise of the Yangtze's baiji river dolphins, which used sonar to communicate.But it's one thing to ban fishing—it would be quite another to completely stop the busy river traffic which delivers passengers as well as goods, and provides for much of central China.Their research, published in the Bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, records a drastic increase in fish numbers since the ban came into effect in 2021.",Negative
US-Mexico border wall to be painted black to stop climbers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq587vpe46eo,"– The entire US-Mexico border wall will be painted black to make it hotter and harder to climb, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said, crediting the idea to President Trump. About a half mile (0.8km) of wall is going up each day along the nearly 2,000 mile border, according to Noem.The number of border crossings has plummeted in recent months, and the Trump administration says sweeping arrests and detentions are acting as a deterrent to illegal migration. Speaking to reporters along a section of the border in New Mexico, Noem said on Tuesday that the black paint was ""specifically at the request of the president."" ""[He] understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb,"" she added. Border Patrol officials also say that black paint will help prevent the wall from rusting.",Positive
