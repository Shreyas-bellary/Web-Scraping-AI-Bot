Officials warn that the death toll may rise significantly as entire villages were destroyed.Several nations have already pledged aid, while some villages remain inaccessible and local health facilities have been overwhelmed.The disaster comes as Afghanistan reels from a severe drought, aid cuts and what the World Food Programme describes as an unprecedented hunger crisis.The earthquake hit at 23:47 local time (19:47 GMT) on Sunday, some 17 miles east of Jalalabad - the country's fifth-largest city, in eastern Nangarhar province. Faridullah Fazli was fast asleep at home in Asadabad, on the banks of the Kunar River, when the tremor jolted him awake.""There was a very strong earthquake, accompanied by sounds that were very scary,"" he told the BBC.""We didn't sleep until morning. After the earthquake, there were small tremors, and there are still.""Mr Fazli said he went to the clinic in town, helping transport the dead and wounded into ambulances to be taken to a hospital further south in Nangarhar province.""It was a very scary situation, just an atmosphere of fear and terror,"" he said.",Negative

"How the death of a delivery driver ignited Indonesia Protests over corruption and inequality have spiralled into violence, arson and deaths.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dj9w306wzo,"– Protesters have been killed, buildings torched, and politicians' houses looted as anti-government unrest spreads across Indonesia—and the authorities respond with force.Mass demonstrations, fuelled by cost-of-living woes and public frustration with the political elite, first erupted in Jakarta on 25 August to condemn what many viewed as excessive pay and housing allowances for parliamentarians.President Prabowo Subianto and the chief of police apologized for his death—but it fuelled further discontent that has now spread to various corners of the archipelago, from West Java to the islands of Bali and Lombok.It is unclear where the protests will go from here—whether they will continue to spiral into further violence and repression or force the government to cede more ground.President Prabowo also ordered the military and police to take stronger action against rioters, looters, and arsonists after homes of political party members and state buildings were ransacked and set ablaze.Meanwhile, everyday Indonesians were struggling because of a cost-of-living crisis.""As the government is undertaking austerity measures, and at a time when citizens are feeling economically insecure, the notion that Indonesia's already wealthy political class would see their incomes rise filled people with rage, and they spilled onto the streets to express that rage,"" Dr Eve Warburton, director of the Indonesia Institute at the Australian National University, told the BBC.These protests spiralled after Affan's death, and have since grown to encompass issues of police brutality and accountability.It is not only about one issue, but about long-standing concerns with inequality, governance and accountability.President Prabowo announced on Sunday that several state-funded perks given to politicians would be reined in, including the size of some allowances.",Negative
"Nestle fires boss after romantic relationship with employee The food giant says Laurent Freixe had an ""undisclosed"" relationship with ""a direct subordinate"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpm9ee9p9o,"– Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate.""The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director.Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

Body seen in secret mortuary could solve 50-year mystery of vanished religious leader Compelling evidence to suggest Lebanese Shia leader Musa al-Sadr was killed in Libya is uncovered by BBC.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr1qr529xo,"– A journalist who saw the body in a secret mortuary in the Libyan capital in 2011 was told then that it could be charismatic cleric Musa al-Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978.Sadr's disappearance has spawned endless conspiracy theories.Some people believe he was killed, while others claim he is still alive and being held somewhere in Libya.For his ardent followers, his disappearance holds the same level of intrigue as the 1963 killing of US President John F Kennedy.The digitised photo is of a decomposed face and it is about to be run through a special algorithm for our BBC investigation.The original photo was taken by a journalist who saw the body in a secret mortuary in Tripoli.The wonder with which the villagers share this story today reflects just how mythologised he has become.Sadr's disappearance also arguably changed the fate of the world's most politically, religiously and ethnically volatile region - the Middle East.Some believe the Iranian-Lebanese cleric was on the verge of using his influence to take Iran - and, as a result, the region - in a more moderate direction when he disappeared on the eve of the Iranian revolution.Sadr's followers gave him the title of imam, an unusual honor for a living Shia cleric and one bestowed on him in recognition of his work on behalf of the Shia community.His mysterious disappearance has added to his emotional power because it echoes the fate—according to the largest branch of Shia Islam, known as Twelvers—of the ""hidden"" 12th imam, who disappeared in the 9th Century.",Negative
"Israel committing genocide in Gaza, world's leading experts say The world's leading association of genocide scholars cited several actions by Israel, including attacks on the healthcare sector and the killing of children.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o,"– The world's leading association of genocide scholars has declared that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.A resolution passed by the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) states that Israel's conduct meets the legal definition as laid out in the UN convention on genocide.Across a three-page resolution, the IAGS presents a litany of actions undertaken by Israel throughout the 22-month-long war that it recognizes as constituting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the report was based on ""Hamas lies"" and poor research, calling it an ""embarrassment to the legal profession.""Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defense.The IAGS scholars state that while the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack—in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage—was itself a crime, Israel's response has not only been directed against Hamas but has targeted Gaza's entire population.The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany, defines genocide as crimes committed ""with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.""",Negative

Putin's spokesman said.The meeting came after scenes of hand-holding between the pair as they were hosted by China's Xi Xinping for the Shanghai Co-operation Organization summit, which is being seen as a challenge to US President Donald Trump and US dominance on a global level.Trump has imposed US tariffs of 50% on goods from India as a way of punishing Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons.The tariffs—among the highest in the world—include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia, which are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.India, a vital strategic US partner in the Indo-Pacific, has shown no signs of stopping its purchases, and the camaraderie with Putin in Tianjin is being seen in the context of the Trump threats.",Negative
