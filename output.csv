"Amazon services 'recovering' as Snapchat and banks among sites hit by outage Platform outage checker Downdetector said the issues have impacted more than 1,000 different businesses.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pgp3nx07o,"– Many of the world's largest websites, including Snapchat, Reddit, and Roblox, were knocked offline on Monday after a huge Amazon Web Services outage.More than 1,000 apps and websites—including banks such as Lloyds and Halifax—were impacted by problems at the heart of the cloud computing giant's operations in the US, according to platform outage monitor Downdetector.It said user reports of problems globally had soared to more than 6.5 million during the outage on Monday morning.Amazon later said it had fixed the underlying problem, but issues for some services persisted, and experts said the outage demonstrates the perils of many companies relying on a single, dominant provider.The issues appear to have begun at around 07:00 BST on Monday, as users began to report problems accessing a slew of platforms.This included a wide range of different sites and services, from massive online games like Fortnite to the language-learning app Duolingo.Downdetector told the BBC it had seen more than four million reports from users across 500 sites within just a few hours—more than double the amount it would see across an entire regular weekday.It said in an update on its service status web page the issue ""appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1.""Once you have a concentrated supply in a handful of monopoly providers, when something like this falls over, it takes a huge percentage of the economy out with it,"" she said.Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, told the BBC the AWS outage highlighted the power cloud services have over how the internet works.""Everyone has a bad day, today Amazon had a bad day,"" he said.Downdetector told the BBC it had seen more than four million reports from users across 500 sites within just a few hours.",Negative
"What has caused the outage at more than 1,000 companies? The outage at Amazon services has impacted over 1,000 companies and affected millions of internet users.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev1en9077ro,"– Amazon Web Services (AWS) has had a bad day.That's how the boss of another big US tech firm put it—probably feeling very relieved that today's outage, hitting over 1,000 companies and affecting millions of internet users, had nothing to do with him.The places hit by the outage vary significantly. AWS is a US giant with a large global footprint, having positioned itself as the backbone of the internet.It provides tools and computers which enable around a third of the internet to work, it offers storage space and database management, it saves firms from having to maintain their own costly set-ups, and it also connects traffic to those platforms.That's how it sells its services: let us look after your business's computing needs for you.A chorus of experts have said today is a textbook illustration of the risks of putting all of your eggs in one basket in terms of a service provider - AWS is a giant and millions of businesses rely on it.The places hit by the outage vary significantly.It took out major social media platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and games like Roblox and Fortnite.",Positive
