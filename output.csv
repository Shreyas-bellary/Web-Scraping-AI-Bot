"People who come off slimming jabs regain weight four times faster than dieters Overweight people shed large amounts on jabs but gain 0.8 kg a month on average once off them, study shows.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c050ljnrv2qo,"– Slimmers who come off weight-loss injections such as Mounjaro or Wegovy can regain their lost pounds four times faster than those who stop conventional dieting and exercising, new research suggests. Data published in the British Medical Journal suggests overweight people shed large amounts when using jabs—about a fifth of their body weight—but once they quit they regain 0.8 kg every month, on average.That means they return to their pre-treatment weight in a year and a half.""People buying these need to be aware of the risk of fast weight regain when the treatment ends,"" warns investigator Dr Susan Jebb, from Oxford University.It's plausible that being lighter for even two to three years due to short-term use of the jabs could help slow damage to joints or the heart and kidneys.GPs and specialist weight-management services cannot automatically prescribe Mounjaro and Wegovy, even if patients have already been prescribed it privately.The drugs can be offered to those in greatest clinical need who meet certain criteria, such as having weight-related health problems.A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company that makes Mounjaro, said use of weight-loss drugs needed to be accompanied by healthy eating, physical activity and medical follow-up.""It was like something opened up in my mind and said: 'Eat everything, go on, you deserve it because you haven't eaten anything for so long.'""",Positive
