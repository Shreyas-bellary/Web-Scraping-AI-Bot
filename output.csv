Trump says he may give Hungary an exemption on Russian oil sanctions Trump has recently increased pressure on US allies to curb their spending on Russian oil.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85dvnkpv4o,"– President Trump says he will consider allowing Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to buy Russian oil, in an exemption from sanctions aimed at helping to end the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an allowance might be made because ""it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas.""Trump asked him: ""So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?"" To which Orban replied: ""You know, a miracle can happen.""Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal talks since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.""He understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future"", Trump said.Orban, who is one of Trump's closest allies in Europe and who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither ""ideological"" nor ""political"" but a ""physical reality"" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary.",Negative
"US will fully pay Snap food benefits, agriculture department says The Trump administration, though, is asking the Supreme Court to let it freeze the aid during the federal shutdown.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpxqd0141o,"– The US government is working to fully pay for food benefits for more than 42 million Americans, according to the agriculture department, even as the Trump administration asks the Supreme Court to let it freeze funding.Funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, were put on pause on 1 November, with the administration saying there was not enough money available due the US government shutdown—now in its 38th day.A judge on Thursday ordered the government to fully fund the program, which one in eight Americans depend on.Trump has repeatedly said that Snap is used by Americans in Democrat states and said the program would be funded once Democrats end the government shutdown.Both Republican and Democrat-led states administer Snap with funding from the federal government.Some this week stepped in with their own money to keep the aid, which works out to about $6 per person per day, flowing to those in the program.The confirmation from the USDA on its website marks what could be the end of one of the major through-points of the longest government shutdown is US history.",Positive
DNA pioneer James Watson dies at 97 The Nobel Prize winner felt ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and intelligence.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xdypnz32o,"– Nobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside a British scientist, Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But his reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex.Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.DNA was discovered in 1869, but researchers had yet to discover its structure, and it took until 1943 before scientists realized that DNA made up the genetic material in cells.Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Watson sold his Nobel gold medal at auction for $4.8m (£3.6m) in 2014, saying he was letting go of the medal because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his remarks on race.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.",Positive
