"Hamas returns remains of two more hostages but says more time needed to reach others The group's armed wing says it has returned the bodies it can reach in Gaza's ruins, but needs specialised equipment and more time to retrieve others.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w9py9940go,"– Hamas says it has handed over the bodies of two more Israeli hostages under the terms of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, but says it needs time and specialized equipment to recover the rest of the deceased from the ruins of Gaza.The group's armed wing said in a statement it was committed to the deal but had returned all the bodies of hostages it was able to reach.Israel has returned the bodies of a further 45 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry confirmed on Wednesday, bringing the total number of bodies released by Israel to 90.Senior US advisors providing an update on the implementation of the 20-point peace plan said that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving the remains of remaining deceased hostages.The latest repatriations came after Israel said one of four bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday was not one of the missing hostages. Hamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan.But Hamas's armed wing said in a statement ""the remaining bodies require significant efforts and specialized equipment to search for and retrieve, and we are making a great effort to close this file.""",Positive
"'Worse than starting from scratch': How big is the task of rebuilding Gaza? BBC Verify investigates the damage done by two years of war, which could take $70bn and decades to repair.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5e4ee9r13o,"– As thousands of Gazans made the journey back to their neighborhoods following the ceasefire, many of them already knew their homes were in ruins.The prospect of rebuilding homes, businesses and all the institutions and services needed for a return to normal life in Gaza is daunting by any measure: the UN estimates that the damage amounts to $70bn.As Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, says: ""It's worse than starting from scratch - here you aren't starting in the sand, you are starting with rubble.""The level of destruction on the strip is ""now in the region of 84%. In certain parts of Gaza, like in Gaza City, it's even up to 92%"", says Jaco Cilliers, UN Development Program special representative for the Palestinians.Over the course of the war, the UN's satellite center Unosat estimates a total of 282,904 houses and apartments across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.Clean water is a major immediate need for Gazans.According to estimates from Unicef, more than 70% of the territory's 600 water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October 2023.As Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, says: ""It's worse than starting from scratch - here you aren't starting in the sand, you are starting with rubble.""",Negative
"China seizes 60,000 maps over 'mislabelled' Taiwan The maps also omitted ""important islands"", the source of competing claims between Beijing and its neighbours.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr1myxe673o,"– Chinese customs officers in eastern Shandong province have seized 60,000 maps that ""mislabelled"" the self-governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. The maps, authorities said, also ""omitted important islands"" in the South China Sea, where Beijing's claims overlap with those of its neighbors, including the Philippines and Vietnam.The ""problematic"" maps, meant for export, cannot be sold because they ""endanger national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of China, authorities said.China Customs said that the maps also did not contain the nine-dash line, which demarcates Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea.The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan.The statement from China Customs did not say where the seized maps were intended to be sold.China sees self-ruled Taiwan its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island.But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders.",Positive
"As US shutdown starts to bite, how much could it hit economy? As workers start to miss pay, the impact of the shutdown will start to ripple out across industries.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9861edyjlno,"– Michael Galletly, an IT management specialist put on unpaid leave this month, sat down with his wife last week, combing through bills and spending more than two hours strategising how to make it through the government shutdown. The impasse has already snarled travel, delayed government approvals for permits and loans and shuttered some museums.Now as millions of federal workers across the government start to miss paycheques this week and respond by curtailing spending, analysts say the impact will start to reverberate more widely.""We're reaching this critical inflection point in terms of the government shutdown and its ramifications for the broader economy,"" said Stash Graham, managing director of Graham Capital Management.The impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically temporary and limited - kind of like the disruption from a hurricane or major storm. Analysts this year project a hit to quarterly growth of roughly 0.2 percentage points per week - roughly $15bn (£11.2bn) - much of which would be made up after the shutdown ends, when federal workers typically receive back pay.In Utah, Mr Galletly said he had started to pull back his purchases in the lead-up to the shutdown, scrapping plans to buy a camper trailer, opting for a second-hand laptop for his daughter, and postponing plans to replace windows, including one that is leaking.The 43-year-old, who asked the BBC not to publish her full name due to concern it would expose her to political attacks, said her family has little wiggle room in its budget after the jump in living costs in recent years.When the shutdown started, they immediately reached out to the bank to ask if they could defer November's mortgage payment.",Negative

Trump confirms he authorised CIA action inside Venezuela But the president would not be drawn on whether the CIA had been told to topple Nicolas Maduro.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ex1jq9pdvo,"– US President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela - and said he was considering strikes targeting drug cartels there.Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US ""is looking at land"" as it considers further strikes in the region.Trump has sought to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro, who the US and others do not recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader following disputed elections.The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organization called the Cartel of the Suns, which it says includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine, and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.Speaking at the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.""Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?"" a reporter asked.I authorized for two reasons really,"" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about a spy agency whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy.""Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.""And the other thing are drugs.We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.""Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity.",Negative
Supreme Court weighs 'earthquake' ruling that could reshape political map The court's decision could lead to the redrawing of congressional districts across the US south.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd67q9vq967o,"– The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in a case that could dramatically reshape the electoral politics of the American south.The court heard a challenge to a central pillar of the Voting Rights Act, which was originally designed to protect the electoral power of black Americans in the face of state-sanctioned discrimination.Although the session was scheduled for only an hour, it stretched for more than twice as long, with the nine justices peppering lawyers in the case with questions.The case in question arises from relatively modest beginnings—a lawsuit by black voters in Louisiana seeking to force the state to draw a second majority black congressional district.Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits states from denying or limiting voting rights on the basis of race, skin color or preferred language.Over the decades since that law's passage, the Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to require that states create ""opportunity districts"" that allow sizable minority populations to elect legislators in a proportion equal to their share of the state's population.Approximately 31% of Louisiana's population is black, but only one of the state's six congressional districts has a black majority.The oral arguments are basically what we expected,"" Prof Charles said.",Positive
Judge orders Trump administration to pause shutdown layoffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2056ynn2ppo,"– A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the government shutdown. It comes less than a week after the administration confirmed several agencies had begun laying off about 4,000 workers. US District Judge Susan Illston granted a request by two unions to block layoffs at more than 30 agencies.During the hearing, Illston said she agreed with the unions that the administration was unlawfully using the lapse in funding, which began on 1 October, to carry out its plans to downsize the federal government. She also cited a series of public statements by President Donald Trump and the White House's budget chief, Russell Vought, that she said showed explicit political motivations for the layoffs, such as Trump saying that cuts would target 'Democrat agencies.' A US justice department lawyer said that the unions must bring their claims to a federal labor board before going to court.The Trump administration is expected to appeal against the restraining order.On Friday, major departments such as Treasury and Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed they were issuing notices to employees.A filing from the Office of Management and Budget revealed more than a quarter of the cuts were to be made at the Treasury Department, where notices were being sent to approximately 1,446 employees.",Positive
US revokes visas over comments made about Charlie Kirk's death,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0x4e3zn2jo,"– The Trump administration has cancelled the visas of at least six people for public comments made about the murder of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.In a post on X, the State Department said: ""The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.""It shared screenshots of six social media posts which it said were examples of foreign visa holders welcoming Kirk's death in September, and suggested further visa cancellations would follow.Kirk, an ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at a university event in Utah.The six people who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and Paraguay, according to the department.It is unclear when the department revoked the visas and what type of visa each person held.The Trump administration's visa cancellations mirror a larger effort by Republicans to target Kirk's critics in the wake of his death, with Vice-President JD Vance urging people to ""call their employer"" to report those who celebrated the killing.The conservative influencer who became the voice of Maga youthWho is the suspect in custody for shooting Kirk?Katty Kay: America is at a dangerous crossroadsThe announcement of the visa cancellations came the same day as President Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom.",Negative
