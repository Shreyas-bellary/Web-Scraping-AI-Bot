"Has crime in Washington fallen two weeks on from Trump's crackdown? Trump says crimes in the capital ""are down like we wouldn't believe"" following his crackdown.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpzkylg3vo,"– President Trump says his crime crackdown, which began on 11 August, has had an immediate effect: ""The numbers are down like we wouldn't believe, but we believe it."" And he has claimed that it has led to an extended period of time without any murders, a trend he says has not been seen in the city US in decades.So what do the crime figures show? US Attorney General Pam Bondi has been posting a daily tally of arrests since the DC takeover started.On August 25, she posted there had been 1,007 arrests.She has not given a detailed breakdown but US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said nearly half were ""illegal criminals who never should have been in this country to begin with.""The Pentagon has sent 20 military lawyers from its Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps to the US Attorney's Office for DC to help with prosecutions.Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui said from his bench that the criminal justice system in DC ""was not keeping up"" with the large rise in federal prosecutions being brought.Trump has repeatedly criticized police figures—which showed violent crime falling in 2024 and so far in 2025—but we cannot find instances of him publicly rejecting the latest police data showing another fall during his crime crackdown.",Negative
"Taylor Swift's engagement ring, and the celebrity trend for big rocks Georgina Rodríguez, Dua Lipa and Zendaya are just some of the recently-engaged stars with standout rings.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj20v20r79o,"– Taylor Swift has announced her engagement to her partner Travis Kelce, sharing a series of pictures, including one of the ring, on Instagram.The post was accompanied by the caption: ""Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.""Not every English teacher can afford a diamond ring costing six or even seven figures, however.Jewellery journalist Rachael Taylor said the softer sparkle on the stone was likely because it was an antique cut by hand rather than by machine.She added that Swift's ring plays into a trend towards vintage styles with different cuts and oversized stones, which fits into the singer's ""romantic"" aesthetic.""Whenever a celebrity gets engaged, if their ring is particularly standout, it's always going to spark a bit of interest in that,"" Ms Faulker added.",Positive
"Denmark apologises to Greenland's forced contraception victims Mette Frederiksen says sorry to to women who were fitted with devices, sometimes without their knowledge.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yelp5466no,"– Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued a long-awaited apology to the Greenlandic women and their families affected by what she called ""systematic discrimination"" during a contraceptive campaign.During the 1960s and 70s thousands of Inuit women and girls as young as 12 were fitted with contraceptive devices, as part of a birth-control program administered by Danish doctors.""We cannot change what has happened. But we can take responsibility,"" Frederiksen said of the scandal.""On behalf of Denmark, I would like to say sorry,"" she said, acknowledging that victims had ""experienced both physical and psychological harm.""An apology, that's nice of course, and makes my clients happy.That's part of what they need,"" said Mads Pramming, the lawyer representing the women told the BBC.Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, and did not gain home rule until 1979, however Copenhagen continued to oversee the healthcare system, before Greenland took responsibility in 1992. Records from the national archives showed that, between 1966 and 1970, 4,500 women and girls, some as young as 13, had an IUD implanted.Of these, it is unclear how many cases lacked consent.The scale of the birth control was so widespread that Greenland's population growth severely slowed.Speaking on Danish television last December, the former Prime Minister of Greenland, Mute B Egede, said it was ""genocide.""Even though we do not have the full picture,"" Frederiksen said, ""it makes a serious impression on the government, that so many Greenlandic women unanimously report that they have been subjected to abuse by the Danish healthcare system.""This case is one of several controversies involving the Danish treatment of Greenlanders, including forced adoptions, the removal of Inuit children from their families, and contributed to calls for independence.",Negative

Documents released by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) also show that staff there raised concerns about why the body had not issued a fine to the MoD.The MoD said they had worked to improve data security, but an ICO spokesperson said the government had not yet done enough to learn the lessons.Hidden tabs are a common feature in spreadsheet software and make information invisible to the user, but still easily accessible if the settings on a document are changed.The government estimates that the 2022 leak, which led to an emergency resettlement scheme for people at risk of persecution by the Taliban, will eventually cost around £850m.A super-injunction granted by the High Court in September 2023 prevented the incident being reported for almost two years, before the order was lifted last month.",Negative

'Punk rock' dinosaur with metre-long spikes discovered,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2emnnn4po,"– Scientists have discovered a bizarre armored dinosaur which had metre-long spikes sticking out from its neck.The species, called Spicomellus afer, lived 165 million years ago, and is the oldest example of a group of armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurs.The elaborateness and spikiness of the animal found in Morocco has come as a shock to experts, who now have to rethink how these armored dinosaurs evolved.Prof Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham who co-led the research, told BBC News that it was the ""punk rocker"" of its time.It is one of the strangest dinosaurs ever discovered. Prof Butler's project co-leader, Prof Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly on to the bone.It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.""If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armour,"" he told BBC News.It was only later in the Cretaceous, when we start to see gigantic dinosaurs with huge jaws and crushing bites, that they actually then needed to co-opt these display structures as body armor.""It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur,"" she said.",Negative
