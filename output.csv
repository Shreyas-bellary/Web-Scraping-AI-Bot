"South Korea would accept a Trump-Kim deal to freeze nuclear programme, president tells BBC Lee Jae Myung tells the BBC he wants to restore trust with North Korea.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy91w0e1z2o,"– South Korea's president has said he would agree to a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons, rather than get rid of them.Lee Jae Myung told the BBC North Korea was producing an additional 15-20 nuclear weapons a year and that a freeze—as ""an interim emergency measure""—would be ""a feasible, realistic alternative"" to denuclearisation for now.Lee said it was ""impossible to know"" but based on his current knowledge this was not his understanding.Earlier this month Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed Kim at a military parade in Beijing alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and, unlike in past meetings, China did not publicly mention the North's nuclear weapons or denuclearisation.The burgeoning ties between Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang, on show at China's parade, put South Korea in ""a very difficult situation"", Lee said.President Lee, who entered office in June, wants to establish peaceful relations with North Korea and reduce tensions, which flared under his predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for trying to impose martial law last year.The South Korean leader has been vocal about wanting President Trump to resume nuclear talks with Kim, which broke down in 2019 during Trump's first term, after the US asked the North to dismantle its nuclear facilities.",Negative

How Russian-funded fake news network aims to disrupt election in Europe - BBC investigation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5kl0n5d2o,"– A secret Russian-funded network is attempting to disrupt upcoming democratic elections in an eastern European state, the BBC has found.Using an undercover reporter, we discovered the network promised to pay participants if they posted pro-Russian propaganda and fake news undermining Moldova's pro-EU ruling party ahead of the country's 28 September parliamentary ballot.Participants were paid to find supporters of Moldova's pro-Russia opposition to secretly record—and also to carry out a so-called poll.The results of this selective sampling, an organizer from the network suggested, could lay the groundwork to question the outcome of the election.Moldova may be small, but sandwiched between Ukraine, and EU-member Romania, it has strategic significance for both Europe and the Kremlin, experts say.The World Service infiltrated the network - co-ordinated on the messaging app Telegram - through a link sent to us by a whistleblower.Ana and the other recruits were trained to produce social media posts using ChatGPT.The network, we concluded, is made up of at least 90 TikTok accounts—some masquerading as news outlets—which have posted thousands of videos totalling more than 23 million views and 860,000 likes since January.We shared our findings with US-based Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), and it told us its analysis shows the network could be even pro-Russia.",Positive
