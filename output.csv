They snake their way up many of the cobbled streets of an area called Bairro Alto—or high neighborhood—taking just three minutes to make the journey.The two cars on the Gloria funicular are powered by electric motors.",Negative
Putin says Russia will achieve all aims militarily if Ukraine does not agree deal The Russian leader has rejected calls for a ceasefire as his troops advance.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7dze5n1vo,"– President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is willing to fight to achieve all its objectives if Ukraine does not agree to a deal.He made the remarks in China after attending a huge military parade seen as a challenge to Donald Trump and the US-dominated world order.The US president has tried to persuade Putin to end the war, but the Russian leader, while praising Trump's ""sincere desire"", has so far not done so.Ukraine's president has been highlighting Putin's refusal to meet as a way of urging Trump to impose sanctions on Russia and boost Ukraine's defenses.Putin met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Beijing, after which Kim said North Korea would continue to ""fully support"" Russia's army as a ""fraternal duty.""It seems to me that if common sense prevails, it will be possible to agree on an acceptable solution to end this conflict,"" Putin said.Putin hinted that Western security guarantees after a future peace deal would not relate to the Donbas areas whose inhabitants had opted to join Russia—a reference to widely-criticized votes held in the aftermath of the annexation.Trump pulled Putin out of international isolation last month when he hosted a meeting with him in Alaska.",Positive
Can India retaliate against Trump's 50% tariffs? Prolonged 50% tariffs could shave off as much as 0.8% of India's GDP - so what are Delhi's options?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76llny57zo,"– President Trump's tariff impasse with its largest trading partner has continued far longer than anticipated, trade negotiations with Washington have come to a halt and the already damaged ties are fraying further with daily admonishments from US officials.""Retaliation is a very costly and unproductive strategy because at the end of the day India depends more on the United States than is the case in reverse,"" Ashley Tellis, a professor at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told The Wire portal in an interview.At $86bn, India's goods exports to the US are nearly three times higher than the US's goods exports to India.India's symbolic responses ""in support of a multipolar world"" including deepening engagement with Japan, China, and Russia have been wise moves, Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative told the BBC, adding that direct retaliation at this stage would be premature.""India should wait at least six months to assess the full extent of US actions—not just the 50% tariffs but also any additional measures that may follow, given the unpredictability of Trump and his advisers,"" Srivastava said.The best buffer against the risk of US tariffs will be diversifying export markets, say experts.It is time for India to ""cult economic and diplomatic ties with countries like Mexico, Canada, and China.Another challenge for Indian exporters will be the costs of switching to new markets.Indian exporters have to decide if it is worth it for them to invest in this when there is a high degree of uncertainty about future tariffs"" Jandhyala said.",Positive
Was fatal US strike on Venezuelan 'drug boat' legal? Experts suggest the strike - which killed 11 alleged cartel members - may be illegal under international law.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o,"– US officials have been quick to defend the strike. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham wrote on X that the strike was the ""ultimate - and most welcome - sign that we have a new sheriff in town.""A White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorized the strike on the boat, which they said was crewed by Tren de Aragua members, after it left Venezuela.The Pentagon has declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News: ""we've got incredible assets and they are gathering in the region... those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere."" Questions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strike.Under Article 2(4) of the UN charter, countries can resort to force when under attack and deploying their military in self-defense.Trump has previously accused the Tren de Aragua cartel of conducting irregular warfare against the US, and the state department has designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.But Prof Michael Becker of Trinity College Dublin told BBC Verify that the US actions ""stretches the meaning of the term beyond its breaking point"".""The fact that US officials describe the individuals killed by the US strike as narco-terrorists does not transform them into lawful military targets,"" he said.The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua criminal organization.""Not only does the strike appear to have violated the prohibition on the use of force, it also runs afoul of the right to life under international human rights law,"" he said.",Negative
"Florida aims to ban vaccine mandates for schoolchildren Vaccine mandates are immoral and akin to slavery, says Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0e485wwwo,"– Florida is aiming to become the first US state to cancel all of its vaccine mandates, many of which require children to get jabs against diseases like polio in order to attend public schools. Dr Debra Houry, who resigned in protest last week from her post as the CDC's chief medical officer, told the BBC that the move in Florida could lead to outbreaks of several preventable diseases among students.The Florida Education Association, a group representing more than 120,000 school teachers and administrators, also condemned the move, saying health officials are discussing ""disrupting student learning and making schools less safe.""Dr Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, added: ""It's particularly unfortunate for Florida because its such a big travel hub. They have people coming and going from Florida all over the world.""Dr Debra Houry, who resigned in protest last week from her post as the CDC's chief medical officer, told the BBC that the move in Florida could lead to outbreaks of several preventable diseases among students.Dr Joseph Ladapo, though, pledged several times during Wednesday's news conference to end ""all of them, every last one of them.""This is a public health disaster in the making for the Sunshine State,"" she posted on X.",Negative
"How China spectacle shows dangers of Trump's high risk trade policy Beijing's military parade shows how Trump has created new international bedfellows in just months, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98d5gplj52o,"– The military might of the People's Republic of China was on full display in a parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II on Wednesday.Thousands of miles away, at the White House in Washington DC, Donald Trump was paying attention.""They were hoping I was watching, and I was watching,"" he said.The American president didn't detail his thoughts about the massive celebration sprawled across Tiananmen Square, except that it was ""very, very impressive.""Conspiracies aside, Trump has a soft spot for parades and demonstrations of military might.He welcomed Putin to Alaska last month with a stealth bomber flyover and a red carpet lined with US military jets.Trump's remarks during a meeting in the Oval Office with Polish President Karol Nawrocki, also on Wednesday, shed little light on the matter.Trump also has a soft spot for parades and demonstrations of military might.Unlike Beijing's sleek display of high-tech armaments and precision marching masses, Trump's parade was a low-key homage to America's military history, as World War Two tanks and revolutionary-era soldiers walked casually down Constitution Avenue near the White House.The parade wasn't the only image coming out China this week that American policymakers intent on maintaining a US-led international order might find concerning, however.Trump, of course, views tariffs as integral to his plan to protect American industry and generate new revenue for the federal government.",Negative
UK and allies ready to back Ukraine before and after peace deal The UK and other allies hope to obtain clear US backing for their efforts to shore up Ukraine's defences.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y85x58nj4o,"– On Wednesday night more than Russian 500 drones and 24 cruise missiles were launched at Ukraine.Across the country, as civilians sheltered in basements or on the metro, the air defense guns went to work.Last week, a Russian missile hit a block of flats in Kyiv killing 22 people, including four children, in one of the deadliest strikes since Russia's full-scale invasion.The German government is also playing down expectations of any big announcement at Thursday's meeting.For the time being, like Italy and other coalition members, Berlin has ruled out sending soldiers to Ukraine to police any future peace on the ground.President Trump pressed Putin for that during their summit in Alaska last month, then emerged to cite Putin's argument that finding a final deal would be a better way out of the conflict.The proposed deal includes continuing to train and supply Ukraine's own army.It also envisages European troops being deployed to Ukraine—in unspecified numbers—to deter any future to Russian aggression—a signal that Ukraine can count on its allies ""full solidarity and... commitment"", the lysée source said.John Healey refused to give details, despite being pressed, ""because that will only make Putin wiser.""On Thursday, Macron will host a meeting of that so-called Coalition of the Willing—a grouping of allies of Ukraine, committed to enforcing any peace deal. Putin said in Beijing.Zelensky could always go to Moscow to see him, he said—a ""knowingly unacceptable"" idea, Ukraine's foreign minister was quick to point out.",Positive

Judge overturns Trump administration funding cuts to Harvard,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2x7x03gjo,"– A US federal court has overturned billions in funding cuts by President Donald Trump's administration to Harvard University.Judge Allison Burroughs ruled the government violated the Ivy League college's free speech rights when it revoked around $2bn (£1.5bn) in research funding.The ruling is a major legal victory for Harvard, but is likely to be appealed.The Trump administration accused the college of antisemitism, ""radical left"" ideologies and racial bias when it froze the funding in April.Three other Ivy League colleges, including Columbia University, struck deals with Trump to preserve funding that was at risk due to similar claims by the administration. Judge Burroughs wrote in Wednesday's ruling: ""The Court vacates and sets aside the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters as violative of the First Amendment.""She blocked the administration from stopping any more federal funding to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based college and barred the government from withholding payment on existing grants. Harvard sued the Trump administration over the funding freeze in April, while also pledging to fight antisemitism.Alan Garber, president of the college, said no government ""should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and take control of the university's patents stemming from federally funded research.The Trump administration has been discussing with Harvard a potential deal to allow the university to regain access to federal funding.",Negative
"It's 4,000 miles from Ukraine - but even this Asian city is part of Russia's war",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0e54z7x8o,"– ""A mine came flying towards me,"" recalls Dmitry Afanasyev, who was mobilised to fight in Ukraine.

So, I sent her a picture of my leg and she replied: 'They'll probably saw it off.' 'OK,' I said. Whether I have one leg, or two legs. Whatever."" The port city of Vladivostok is more than 4,000 miles from Ukraine and from Russia's capital.On the orders of President Putin, Russian troops poured across the border with Ukraine in February 2022.The full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbor was widely seen as the Kremlin's attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.More than three and a half years later the war rages on.On air I'm often asked: what do the Russian people think about the war in Ukraine, about confrontation with the West, and about President Putin?""What do Russians think?"" is a difficult question to answer.At a cemetery on a hill overlooking Vladivostok there are lines of fresh graves: Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine.",Negative
