Judge dismisses terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione Judge Gregory Carro also ruled a second-degree murder charge against Mangione could stand during a hearing on Tuesday.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2p8qq5qo,"– A judge in New York state has dismissed two terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.However, Judge Gregory Carro during a hearing on Tuesday morning ruled a charge of second-degree murder against Mangione could stand.He said prosecutors had failed to establish that there was enough evidence to justify the terrorism-related murder charges that they sought against Mangione. Mangione is accused of gunning down Thompson on a busy Manhattan street in December last year.Although prosecutors argued that writings left by Mangione demonstrated a terrorism motive, the judge said they failed to show that the suspect intended to put political pressure on the government or terrorise the general population - key provisions of New York's terrorism law, passed in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks.The first-degree murder charge that was dismissed would have carried a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.If convicted of the remaining second-degree murder charge, Mangione faces a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison.Outside the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday a handful of Mangione's supporters gathered, some of them holding placards with slogans such as ""Free Luigi"" and ""Innocent until proven guilty.""",Negative

Why the US is expected to cut interest rates,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75y90pw0o,"– It's finally happening. After months of economic debate and mounting attacks from US President Donald Trump, the US central bank is poised to cut interest rates on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce it is lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points. That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25%—the lowest level since late 2022.The move—the bank's first rate cut since last December—is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US. But they carry a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates. Nor are they likely to satisfy the president, who has called for far deeper cuts. On social media, he has called Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell ""a real dummy"", accusing him of holding back the economy by leaving interest rates too high for too long.",Positive
