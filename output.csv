Sixteen years on, Perales, who is now 68, is joining thousands of other militia members getting ready for a potential US attack.The rag-tag force, mainly made up of senior citizens, has been called up following the deployment of US navy ships in the South Caribbean on what US officials said were counter-narcotics operations.The US force has destroyed at least three boats it said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 17 people on board.Venezuela's defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said the attacks and the US naval deployment amounted to a ""non-declared war"" by the US against Venezuela and President Nicols Maduro swiftly called the militia into active duty.Maduro has ordered the Venezuelan military—the National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB)—to train local militias like the one to which Edith Perales belongs.These groups are mostly made up of volunteers from poor communities, although public sector workers have reported being pressured into joining them as well.While experts have told the BBC that the deployment of US naval forces in the South Caribbean is large, they have also pointed out that it is not large enough to suggest that it is part of a planned invasion.Maduro has vehemently rejected Washington's accusations and has defended his government's actions against drug trafficking.",Negative

How weight-loss injections are turning obesity into a wealth issue,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre5xp83394o,"– Weight-loss drugs have been available on the NHS for some time, but the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of some newer medications—among them, semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.Wegovy was first prescribed for obesity by the NHS in 2023, while Mounjaro followed earlier this year.An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs—but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately.Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support.So could it really be that weight-loss injections—for all of their benefits—are turning obesity into a wealth issue? Weight-loss drugs have been available on the NHS for some time, but the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of some newer medications—among them, semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of depravation where obesity rates are significantly higher.""We cannot allow good health to become a luxury for the wealthiest by limiting access to weight-loss drugs to those who can pay privately,"" argues Katharine Jenner, executive director of Obesity Health Alliance.So could it really be that weight-loss injections—for all of their benefits—are turning obesity into a wealth issue?",Positive
