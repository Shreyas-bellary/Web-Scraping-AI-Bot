So what changed now?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75x9wqwz40o,"– The trade deal between India and the European Union is as much about geopolitics as it's about intercontinental business relations.The EU is already India's largest partner with trade in goods reaching $142.3 billion (£104.07 billion) in 2024, amounting to 11.5% of the South Asian nation's total trade.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen both called Tuesday's agreement ""the mother of all deals"".""This is the tale of two giants—the world's second and fourth largest economies—two giants who choose partnership in a true win-win fashion, a strong message that co-operation is the best answer to global challenges,"" said von der Leyen, standing beside Modi after they exchanged agreements.""One could argue that the Trump factor provided a very strong impetus to the deal because both India and the EU are facing shock US tariffs that they never expected,"" said Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council.He added that Trump is a big reason why the EU and India have been able to overcome most of their differences and put issues they couldn't resolve on the back-burner for future negotiations.The US has imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which include a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia.The trade deal also gives the EU access to another huge market and may help it reduce its reliance on China in the future.""India will also look at this partnership as a way to counter China's dominance in global trade, which it envisaged doing with the US,"" Modi said.It sends a message to Trump that global powers have started to cope with global unpredictability.",Positive
