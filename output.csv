"France transfixed by murder trial without a body Cédric Jubillar has always denied killing his wife Delphine, who vanished in December 2020.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz69nppezlzo,"– A French murder trial that opened Monday has transfixed the public because of the mystery at its core: where is the victim's body?""Cédric Jubillar, a 38 year-old painter-decorator, is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago in a fit of jealous rage.He has always denied the charges and, other than circumstantial evidence, investigators have struggled to build a case.With its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.The trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts.Police and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside—with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.Delphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.The Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when—in the early hours on 16 December 2020—Cédric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.Delphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region.Cédric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job.Cédric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.Two of his acquaintances—a former cellmate and a former girlfriend—will also repeat what they told police: that Cédric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.But after more digging no body has been found, and the defense is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.",Negative
"Sarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein email Seven charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, remove the former wife of Prince Andrew as a patron or ambassador.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddmr6v0jpzo,"– Seven charities have dropped the Duchess of York as a patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her ""supreme friend"" and seemed to apologize for her public criticism of him.Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex-wife, saying it was ""inappropriate"" for her to continue in the role.The Teenage Cancer Trust, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Children's Literacy Charity, National Foundation for Retired Service Animals and Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped the duchess as patron.The British Heart Foundation said she would no longer be its ambassador.A spokesperson for the duchess said she was not commenting on the charities' decisions to end their links with her.Prince Andrew's former husband, the Duke of York, had previously had to stand down as a working royal and lost his patronages after challenges over his own associations with Epstein, including in a BBC Newsnight interview in 2019.The duchess had joined forces with Prevent Breast Cancer in 2024 following her own breast cancer treatment the year before.Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew's ex-wife, saying it was ""inappropriate"" for her to continue in the role.",Negative
"US Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officials The ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kw082djn4o,"– The US Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump can dismiss a top official on the Federal Trade Commission. In the 6-3 ruling, the justices sided with Trump, allowing him to fire Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter from her post while legal challenges continue.It has also agreed to revisit a nearly century-old legal precedent that shields independent agencies set up by Congress from presidential interference.Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenting liberal justices, warned that the ruling allows the president to take charge of institutions Congress had intended to protect from partisanship.The FTC, which enforces consumer protection, typically has five commissioners - three from the president's party and two from the opposing party.Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the FTC, were fired by Trump in March. A federal judge ruled in July in favor of Slaughter, declaring her dismissal ""unlawful"" under the longstanding precedent.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued a temporary order permitting Trump to proceed with the dismissal as the justices considered whether to take up the case - a move now confirmed by Monday's decision.Separately, the court is also considering the Trump administration's request to remove Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor.",Positive
ICC charges Rodrigo Duterte with crimes against humanity The former president of the Philippines is accused of being involved in the deaths of dozens of people.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5e1v85lrdo,"– The 80-year-old is accused of being criminally responsible for dozens of murders that allegedly took place as part of his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users, and others were killed without trial.The ICC's charge sheet, which includes several redactions, dates from July but was only made public on Monday.Mr Duterte said he cracked down on drug dealers to rid the country of street crimes. Rodrigo Duterte is the first Asian former head of state to be indicted by the ICC—and the first suspect to be flown to the Hague in Netherlands—where the court is based—in over three years.The other two charges relate to times when he was serving as president of the Philippines, between 2016 and 2022, and launched his so-called war on drugs.Mr Duterte's supporters alleged the ICC was being used as a political tool by the country's current president Ferdinand Marcos, who had publicly fallen out with the powerful Duterte family.The ICC effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused—and Marcos had previously dismissed the idea of co-operating with the ICC.",Negative

"Trump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism link Some studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20d4lr67lo,"– The FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that the announcement ""is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children.""The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.Acetaminophen— Tylenol's active ingredient—is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives.Trump made the announcement on Monday in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. The US president claimed that taking paracetamol, the main ingredient in Tylenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen, ""is no good"" and that pregnant women should only take it in cases of extreme fever.Some studies have shown a link between pregnant women taking Tylenol and autism, but these findings are inconsistent and inconclusive.",Neutral
Copenhagen Airport reopens after drone sightings as origins still unclear,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4lj1yvgvgo,"– Flights at Copenhagen Airport resumed at around 00:30 local time (23:30 BST) after flights were suspended for almost four hours following a drone sighting.

Trump designates Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5j085207do,"– President Trump signed an order designating Antifa as a ""domestic terrorist organization"" on Monday as part of efforts to crack down on the ""radical left"" in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump's order directs all agencies and departments to ""investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations...conducted by Antifa"" and its supporters.Investigators have yet to establish a motive in Kirk's killing and there is no evidence to suggest the murder suspect was affiliated with Antifa.Antifa - short for anti-fascist - is a decentralised, leftist movement that opposes far-right, racist, and fascist groups that has long been a top target of Trump and other Republicans.It is a loose, leaderless affiliation that lacks a membership list or structure, which raises questions about how Trump will actually target the group. Trump said in 2020 that he would declare Antifa a terrorist organization but didn't follow through.His latest intervention comes as part of a wider campaign against the ""radical left"" following the Charlie Kirk killing, with the president declaring that: ""Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.""The US government can classify a group a Foreign Terror Organization but the legal criteria states that the group ""must be a foreign organization."" Designating a group a FTO means members can be banned or removed from the country and gives the US authority to seize funding and target donors.",Negative
