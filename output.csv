Crunch time in Alaska: Trump set to meet Putin in push for Ukraine peace Donald Trump will host Vladimir Putin in Alaska - their first meeting in six years - as he tries to secure a Ukraine war ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qy1neql8lo,"– The US president, who has portrayed himself as a global peacemaker, hopes to leverage his personal relationship with Putin to achieve a ceasefire breakthrough where others have failed.On Thursday he assessed there was a ""25% chance"" the meeting would not be successful.Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky has been excluded from the talks, and warned that any resolutions made in his absence will be meaningless.The issue has become central to the question of what Trump has delivered on the world stage since returning to the US presidency.Trump has a domestic audience to keep happy, and many of his supporters backed him for his pledge to swiftly end the war and disentangle America from expensive foreign conflicts more generally.Friday's meeting between the two leaders will take place entirely on a nearby US military base—a reflection of security concerns and the relative brevity of the planned sit-down, currently scheduled to last just a few hours.The summit comes exactly one week after Trump's deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire or face tough new sanctions.It was always highly unlikely that Kyiv and Moscow—who have been locked in a bloody war since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022—would reach an agreement to end hostilities before that deadline.Europe finds itself in the unenviable position of being caught between the two sides and excluded from Friday's discussion.During their last-minute call with Trump on Wednesday, European leaders emerged tentatively optimistic that once in Alaska the US president would fight their corner.Like Ukraine itself, they have endured several turbulent months, during which Trump had a memorable White House bust-up with Zelensky and later temporarily paused military supplies for Kyiv—a markedly different stance to his predecessor Joe Biden.Despite protests by the Ukrainian leader that any agreement struck by Trump and Putin without input from Kyiv would amount to ""dead decisions"" it became increasingly clear as the week progressed that the US-Russia meeting would remain a bilateral only.",Negative
"Left out of Alaska talks, exhausted Ukrainians fear an unjust peace No matter what happens between Trump and Putin, Ukrainians think Russia has no plan to stop the war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7kl7e469o,"– President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska might be essential to saving lives on the front. The continuing preparation for battle suggests few in Ukraine are expecting this war to stop any time soon.The bottom line though is that few believe Russia really wants peace. Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP and Chairman of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Committee, thinks the Alaska meeting is just a PR stunt for President Putin.As for the suggestion that Ukraine hands over more territory to Russia, he says: ""It wouldn't be my suggestion, I don't like this idea.""Ukrainian troops point out that Russia is also taking heavy losses, suffering around 1,000 casualties—dead or injured—every day.The views from the front are reflected in Ukraine's towns and cities.President Zelensky has already expressed his frustration that Ukraine's voice will not be heard in Alaska.As for the suggestion that Ukraine will have to give up territory as part of any ""land swap"": ""It wouldn't be my suggestion, I don't like this idea.""President Trump's suggestion that Ukraine will have to give up territory as part of any ""land swap"": ""It's both morally and legally wrong to sacrifice people's homes for peace.But many Ukrainians have already lost their homes and lives.As for the suggestion that Ukraine hands over more territory to Russia, he says: ""It wouldn't be my suggestion, I don't like this idea.""",Negative
"'We were never friends': A massacre on the eve of WW2 still haunts China-Japan relations Eighty years after Japan was defeated, a wave of Chinese films about the  occupation are fuelling memory and anger.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp89ed9j5ygo,"– Japan's brutal military campaign and occupation are among the darkest chapters of its past—and the massacre in Nanjing, then the capital, an even deeper wound.What has made it fester is the belief that Japan has never fully owned up to its atrocities in places it occupied—not just China, but also Korea, what was then, Philippines, Indonesia.Dead To Rights, or Nanjing Photo Studio, is a star-studded tale about a group of civilians who hide from Japanese troops in a photo studio.The video quickly became one of his most popular, with more than 670,000 likes in just two weeks.But the comments are less positive.In his video, Kato seems to acknowledge that it's not a subject of conversation in Japan: ""Unfortunately these anti-Japanese war movies are not shown in Japan publicly, and Japanese people are not interested to watch them.""For China, Japan's brutal military campaign and occupation are among the darkest chapters of its past—and the massacre in Nanjing, then the capital, an even deeper wound.What has made it fester is the belief that Japan has never fully owned up to its atrocities in places it occupied—not just China, but also Korea, what was then, Philippines, Indonesia.",Negative
Man arrested after sandwich thrown at federal agent in Washington DC Sean Dunn was fired from the Department of Justice after video appeared to show him hurling a deli sandwich at an officer.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wn9zwjyyeo,"– An employee at the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has been arrested for throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent deployed to Washington DC as part of President Donald Trump's vow to crackdown on crime.Sean Charles Dunn, who had worked in the DOJ Criminal Division, was fired after video of the incident emerged.The unusual nature of the incident led to several jokes online, including the comment ""assault with a deli weapon"" - a gag which received more than 1,500 upvotes on Reddit.A local judge declined to press charges, before a federal judge permitted assault charges to be filed, CBS reports.Mr Dunn is currently free on bail and is facing up to eight years in prison.Mr Dunn had been working as a trial attorney for the Office of International Affairs within the DOJ's Criminal Division, according to CBS news, the BBC's US partner.US Attorney for Washington DC Jeanine Pirro said in a video announcing Mr Dunn's arrest that he ""thought it was funny. Well, he doesn't think it's funny today, because we charged with him with a felony.""""So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else,"" she continued.",Negative
California governor unveils voting lines plan to counter Texas Republicans The governor called for a special election to increase the state's Democrats in the US House.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e33w6446o,"– California's Democratic governor has unveiled a high-stakes plan to redraw voting lines in America's most populous state, in order to counter similar efforts by Republicans in Texas.Gavin Newsom called for a special election to be held in November, in which voters would be asked to approve lawmakers redrawing congressional districts before national midterms in 2026.He billed the move as an emergency measure in response to a Donald Trump-backed plan in Texas, which could see the Republicans pick up five more seats in the finely-balanced House.It is the latest development in a gerrymandering fight that runs the risk of setting off a political arms race for control of the US Congress.The governor - whose term in office ends next year and is rumored to have presidential ambitions - said it would neutralize an attempt by Trump and other Republicans to ""rig the system.""He continued: ""We have got to recognize the cards that we have been dealt and we have got to meet fire with fire.""Newsom's proposal would see California retain its current congressional maps if Texas and other states pulled out of any changes.The tit-for-tat move seeks to cancel out projected gains by Republicans in Texas if the state approves a redistricting effort sought by Trump and the state's governor Greg Abbott.Trump has said Texas is ""entitled"" to redraw maps and called on the FBI to put pressure on the state's Democrats to return home, paving the way for a vote.Some are expected to return to the state as early as this weekend, saying they feel their cross-country relocation has helped generate more attention on the issue nationally.Like other states, California typically redraws congressional districts once a decade when new population data is released by the US Census.",Negative
"Bowen: Netanyahu is presiding over a divided Israel - the fault lines are now chasms Jeremy Bowen travelled through Israel to hear views from all sides - from protesters in 'psychological despair' over Gaza, to those who feel an overwhelming sense that their country's actions are justified.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r441zyw27o,"– Israel's longest serving prime minister and by far the dominant force in its politics, has not budged from what he believes is the essential truth about the war in Gaza.""We will fight to defend our homeland. We will fight and not retreat. We will fight on land, at sea and in the air. We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground. We will fight and we will win.""This will be a victory of good over evil, of light over darkness, of life over death.In this war we will stand steadfast, more united than ever, certain in the justice of our cause."" His speech adopted the cadences of Winston Churchill's rallying call in June 1940 of 'we shall fight on the beaches,' after Britain's defeat by Germany in northern France and the evacuation of more than 338,000 allied soldiers from Dunkirk.""Of course, they do a lot of them, they say that if we think the way we think, or we act the way we act, we should just go... to live in Gaza."" polls taken since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) went back to war in Gaza in March, breaking the last ceasefire, suggest that a large majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering in Gaza.On the edge of the anti-Netanyahu demonstration in Tel Aviv, several hundred Israelis stood silently, each holding a placard with the name of a Palestinian child killed by Israel in Gaza.",Negative
Final stage of Jimmy Lai’s landmark national security trial to begin The Hong Kong pro-democracy tycoon has been charged under a Beijing-backed law critics say has been used to crack down on dissent.,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c3ez5xqq0kyt,"– One of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state, media mogul Jimmy Lai is due to appear shortly at a Hong Kong court for closing arguments in his landmark trial Lai has denied charges of ""colluding with foreign forces"" and ""conspiracy to publish seditious material"" which violate Hong Kong's controversial national security law (NSL).

How Trump's drive to his golf course shaped homeless crackdown What the president sees on his journey out of Washington DC helps explain this week's push to clean up the capital.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/czd0r0ej76ro,"– President Trump says his administration will begin removing homeless people from the streets of Washington DC. The announcement came a day after he posted a photo of tents by the side of the road on the way to his golf course - saying that ""the homeless have to move out.""

US wholesale prices jump in July as tariffs hit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp89ej4jrn9o,"– Producers in the US raised their prices at the fastest pace in more than three years last month as companies grappled with new costs from tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump. The producer price index, which measures the selling price commanded by US producers, jumped 0.9% from June to July, after being flat the previous month, according to the Labor Department. That was a much bigger leap than the 0.2% forecast by analysts, who predict that the higher wholesale prices will soon mean higher prices for US consumers.The report renewed worries about inflation in the months ahead, despite recent data showing that the increase in consumer prices had held steady at 2.7% in July.The average effective tariff rate in the US has soared since Trump has come into power and put new levies on most goods entering the country.He says tariffs, which are a tax on imports, will raise money for the government and give US manufacturers an edge over their foreign competitors.But economists have warned that expanding production in the US will be costly and difficult and that the primary impact of the new levies will be higher costs for businesses and consumers.Analysts said the building inflation pressures could also complicate calls for the US central bank to lower interest rates, as Trump has demanded.The Federal Reserve sets its policy independent of the White House.",Negative
AI invents new antibiotics that could kill superbugs gonorrhoea and MRSA,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr94xxye2lo,"– Antibiotics kill bacteria, but infections that resist treatment are now causing more than a million deaths a year.Overusing antibiotics has helped bacteria evolve to dodge the drugs' effects, and there has been a shortage of new antibiotics for decades.Researchers have previously used AI to trawl through thousands of known chemicals in an attempt to identify ones with potential to become new antibiotics.However, the MIT team have gone one step further by using generative AI to design antibiotics in the first place for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea and for potentially-deadly MRSA.Their study, published in the journal Cell, interrogated 36 million compounds including those that either do not exist or have not yet been discovered.The two compounds still need years of refinement and clinical trials before they could be prescribed.AI can enable us to come up with molecules, cheaply and quickly and in this way, expand our arsenal, and really give us a leg up in the battle of our wits against the genes of superbugs.""While AI promises to dramatically improve drug discovery and development, we still need to do the hard yards when it comes to testing safety and efficacy,"" Dr Andrew Edwards, from the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London, said the work was ""very significant"" with ""enormous potential"" because it ""demonstrates a novel approach to identifying new antibiotics.""However, they are not ready for clinical trials and the drugs will require refinement—estimated to take another one to two year's work—before the long process of testing them in people could begin.",Positive
