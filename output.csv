"British spies and Special Forces named in Afghan data breach The personal details of spies and soldiers were included in a data leak that also named 19,000 Afghans.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4ek9njknvo,"– The identities of more than 100 British officials, including members of the special forces and MI6, were compromised in a data breach that also put thousands of Afghans at risk of reprisal, it can be reported.The data breach occurred in February 2022 but was not discovered by the government until August 2023, when someone in Afghanistan who had obtained the data posted part of it on Facebook and indicated he could release the rest.The BBC revealed on Wednesday that the Ministry of Defense (MoD) had offered to expedite a review of the individual's application and brought him to the country after he posted the data—a sequence of events that government sources said was ""essentially blackmail.""The MoD declined to comment on the actions of the individual but said that ""anyone who comes to the UK under any Afghan relocation schemes"" must go through ""robust security checks in order to gain entry.""The discovery of the breach in 2023 forced the government to covertly set up the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR)—a resettlement scheme for those affected, who were not told about the breach despite the risk to their security.The scheme has already allowed 4,500 Afghans and family members to move to the UK and a further 2,400 people are expected, at an estimated cost of £850m.The accidental leak was the result of someone working at UK Special Forces headquarters in London inadvertently emailing more than 30,000 resettlement applications to an individual outside of government, thinking that he was sending data on just 150 people.After the lifting of the super-injunction on Tuesday, a secondary injunction had prevented the revelations about special forces and security services personal being compromised.",Positive
"How bad is Afghan data breach for the UK's intelligence service? For a case officer in MI6, having your name and details outed in public is potentially a career-killer.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07dr898e3po,"– It is arguably the worst leak of secret UK government names since the former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson went rogue and published a list online containing dozens of names of MI6 officers in 1999.For a case officer in the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), having your name and details outed in public is potentially a career-killer.The revelation that, in addition to the thousands of leaked names and details of potentially vulnerable Afghans, there are 100 or more involving British operatives is certainly shocking.But this 'unauthorised data breach' was - belatedly - discovered as far back as August 2023.So that has given the UK intelligence and special forces communities nearly two years in which to come up with ways to mitigate this disaster and adopt whatever protective measures they can, for both Afghans and Brits on the leaked dataset. Amongst the worse-case scenarios that MI6 in particular will have had to consider is that Russia, China, Iran or even North Korea may now also be in possession of those leaked names.It is a fair assumption to make that the Taliban's intelligence apparatus would have had little interest in the names of long-departed British soldiers and spies.For now, those who have most to fear are the 600 former Afghan government soldiers and their estimated 1,800 relatives who are still in Afghanistan.",Negative
"Relentless immigration raids are changing California's way of life A month since Donald Trump called in the National Guard, raids continue to spark violent protests - and fear.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqnpwrq1l4o,"– The National Guard and US Marines have been deployed to protect federal officers from the demonstrators and to ensure that his mass deportations, which he had long promised, were carried out. While many Americans support President Trump's tough immigration policies, the relentlessness of the raids in the region has also triggered a fierce backlash from neighbors and activists. Southern California is home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants, many of whom have been forced into hiding - too afraid to go to work, school or even the grocery store. The raids at the two cannabis farms are now being touted as the largest immigration operation since President Trump took office. While the administration frequently highlights the convicted rapists, murderers, and drug dealers they have arrested in operations, scores of immigrants - many with no criminal convictions who have spent decades building businesses, families, and homes - have been caught in the crosshairs.""They just kidnap you,"" says Carlos, who didn't want his full last name used out of fear that he could be deported to his native Guatemala.

"US passes first major national crypto legislation It marks a milestone for the once fringe industry, as it expands its power in Washington.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd78lvd94zyo,"– Lawmakers in the US have passed the country's first major national cryptocurrency legislation. It is a major milestone for the once fringe industry, which has been lobbying Congress over regulation for years and poured millions into last year's election, backing candidates that included Donald Trump. The bill sets up a regulatory regime for so-called stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency backed by assets seen as reliable, such as the dollar. Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday, after the House passed the bill on Thursday, joining the Senate, which had approved the measure last month. Known as the Genius Act, the bill is one of three pieces of cryptocurrency legislation advancing in Washington that is backed by Trump.The president once derided crypto as a scam but his opinion shifted as he won backing from the sector and got involved in the industry as a businessman, with ties to firms such as World Liberty Financial.Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at providing clear rules for a growing industry, ensuring the US keeps pace with advances in payment systems. The provisions include requiring stablecoins, an alternate cryptocurrency to the likes of Bitcoin, to be backed one-for-one with US dollars, or other low-risk assets.",Positive
Trump orders production of 'pertinent' Epstein grand jury testimony,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w1014rlq9o,"– President Trump says he's ordered the US Justice Department to produce ""all pertinent"" grand jury testimony related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. ""Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Attorney General Pam Bondi posted minutes later: ""We are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.""The development comes after days of sustained pressure from Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) supporters demanding further disclosures in the Epstein case.It's unclear from the post whether Trump is authorising the public release of additional documents or when that could come.",Positive
White House says Trump diagnosed with vein condition after questions about bruises The White House says bruising on his hands is consistent with damage from frequent handshakes while taking aspirin.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jw1pdyp0jo,"– Donald Trump is suffering from a chronic vein condition, the White House announced on Thursday, after days of speculation regarding photographs showing bruising on the US president's hand.After recently experiencing swelling in his legs, Trump underwent a ""comprehensive exam"" including vascular testing, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.Leavitt said Trump's bruised hand was consistent with ""tissue damage from frequent handshaking"" while taking aspirin, which she said is ""part of a standard cardio-vascular prevention regimen.""Trump, 79, has regularly touted his good health and once described himself as ""the healthiest president that's ever lived."" Chronic venous insufficiency only affects the lower part of the body, so the condition is unrelated to the bruising seen on the president's hand, which generated speculation in recent days.The president's doctor said the bruising was a result of handshaking and a side effect of him taking aspirin, a medication which can help prevent heart attacks, blood clots, and strokes.Dr Edwards said he agrees with the White House doctor's explanation that Trump's aspirin intake along with his age could be responsible for the bruising.""We are all more prone to bruising as we get older, and you see that a lot in people that take aspirin and other blood-thinning agents.""I'm sure it could if someone squeezes your hand hard enough, (you could get a bruise),"" Dr Edwards said.",Positive
'Reserved in the womb' and sold for £500: Police bust baby trafficking ring Police uncover an international baby trafficking syndicate which sold at least 25 infants in Singapore.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq536dew1l4o,"– Indonesian police have uncovered an international baby trafficking syndicate which has allegedly sold at least 25 infants to buyers in Singapore since 2023.Authorities made 13 arrests related to the syndicate in the Indonesian cities of Pontianak and Tangerang this week, and rescued six babies who were about to be trafficked—all of whom are around a year old,"" West Java Police's director of general criminal investigation, Surawan, told BBC News Indonesia.Police said members of the group included recruiters who tracked down babies to be trafficked; caretakers for two to three months before being sent to Jakarta and then Pontianak, where their birth certificates, passports, and documents were prepared, police said.The babies were sold for between 11 million Indonesian rupiah ($673; £502) and 16 million Indonesian rupiahs each, they added.Police in Indonesia have requested assistance from Interpol and Singaporean police to arrest syndicate members who are still abroad, as well as buyers.Police in Indonesia have requested assistance from Interpol and Singaporean police to arrest syndicate members who are still abroad, as well as buyers.Child trafficking syndicates typically target women in desperate situations, according to Ai Rahmayanti, commissioner of the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI).""For example, they became pregnant due to sexual violence, abduction by the husband, or unwanted pregnancies resulting from casual relationships and abandonment,"" she told BBC News Indonesia.",Negative

US seeks one day in prison for officer convicted in Breonna Taylor shooting,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d135jz58zo,"– The Trump administration is asking for a one-day prison sentence for a former Kentucky police officer convicted in connection with a raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman, in her home.A federal jury had convicted former officer Brett Hankison of violating Taylor's civil rights by using excessive force—the maximum sentence for the charge is life in prison.If the judge agrees to the US Justice Department's recommendation, Hankison would serve one day prison and absolved of further time behind bars because of time already served.Taylor became a face of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 following her death and the police killing of George Floyd.She was killed after officers in plain clothes executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her home.Hankison was fired from Louisville Metro Police Department in June 2020.Federal prosecutors said that the jury's verdict almost guaranteed that Hankison would never serve as a law enforcement officer again and that additional prison time ""would simply be unjust under these circumstances.""Hankison fired 10 times into her apartment, in order, he said during the trial, to protect fellow officers.None of Hankison's bullets hit anyone, but they did enter a neighboring property, where a pregnant woman, a five-year-old and a man had been sleeping.Taylor became a face of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 following her death and the police killing of George Floyd.She was killed after officers in plain clothes executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her home.Hankison was fired from Louisville Metro Police Department in June 2020.",Negative
