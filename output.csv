"European leaders tentatively hopeful after call with Trump ahead of Putin summit Trump, who described the call as ""a ten"", was urged to keep Ukraine's interests at the forefront when he meets Putin on Friday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0l9e187yo,"– European leaders appeared cautiously optimistic after holding a virtual meeting with Donald Trump on Wednesday, two days before he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.Trump reportedly told the Europeans that his goal for the summit was to obtain a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv.He also agreed that any territorial issues had to be decided with Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, and that security guarantees had to be part of the deal, according to France's Emmanuel Macron.Trump and Vice-President JD Vance spoke to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and NATO chief Mark Rutte.The Europeans have been sidelined from the hastily organized summit in Alaska and their phone call on Wednesday was a last-ditch attempt to keep Ukraine's interests and the continent's security at the forefront of Trump's mind.To an extent, it seemed to work. On Wednesday evening Trump rated the meeting ""a 10"" and said Russia would face ""very severe"" consequences unless it halted its war in Ukraine.He also said that if Friday's meeting went well he would try to organize a ""quick second one"" involving both Putin and Zelensky. European leaders restated the need for Kyiv to be involved in any final decision— betraying an underlying nervousness that Putin could ultimately persuade Trump to concede Ukrainian land in exchange for a ceasefire.",Negative
In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territories at the heart of the Trump-Putin summit Kyiv has rejected ceding territory seized by Russia to secure a ceasefire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrn433lk2o,"– President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska could have major implications for Ukraine. Russia has laid claim to vast parts of Ukraine since 2014, when President Vladimir Putin made his first move.At the time, in the space of a short few months, Moscow carried out the relatively bloodless occupation and annexation of the Crimean peninsula.But that was followed by a Russian-backed separatist movement in the eastern Donbas region—specifically the two regions, or ""oblasts"", known as Donetsk and Luhansk.A war simmered there for eight years. Ukraine lost around 14,000 soldiers and civilians during this period.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect— cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now.President Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin, Trump has started talking, instead about territorial swaps.It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.European allies also insist on a halt in fighting.European allies also insist on a ceasefire.",Positive

Rain warning delays landmark trial of Hong Kong's rebel mogul Jimmy Lai Lai is accused of colluding with foreign forces under a Beijing-imposed national security law.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm2z7497yko,"– He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949.Lai has been a persistent thorn in China's side.But on the mainland he is viewed as a ""traitor"" who threatens Chinese national security.Lai has been a persistent thorn in China's side.When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the ""death knell"" for the territory.The influential entrepreneur also warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as China.Lai has been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing.This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city.But on the mainland he is viewed as a ""traitor"" who threatens Chinese national security.The trial has drawn international attention, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling for Lai's release.The 77-year-old has British as well as Chinese citizenship - though China does not recognize dual nationality, and therefore considers Lai to be exclusively Chinese.Lai has been detained since December 2020 and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if he is convicted.His son Sebastien has called for his release.",Positive
JD Vance - The 'Scots-Irish hillbilly' taking a break in Scotland The vice-president is following Donald Trump to Ayrshire but there are questions over his Scottish heritage.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w8g20wer3o,"– JD Vance stepped onto Scottish soil on Wednesday he became the second inhabitant of the White House to visit the country in a month.The vice-president is believed to be staying in Ayrshire, just north of Galloway, the area he says his forebears left in the 17th Century.But while his boss, President Donald Trump, is half-Scottish—his mother was born in Lewis in the Western Isles—Vance's claim to Caledonian blood has come under some questioning.And this is important because in his own way the vice-president is a follower of the modern creed his Maga allies claim to hate—identity politics.Or as Vance once put it: ""To understand me, you must understand that I am a Scots-Irish hillbilly at heart."" He made that claim in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, a bestseller which was subsequently turned into an Oscar-nominated film starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.The book describes a childhood spent surrounded by poverty and substance abuse in Appalachia, the broad mountainous region which extends across the eastern USA from Canada to the Deep South.It's estimated that about 90% of the area's early European immigrants came in the 17th Century from the lands which stretch along both sides of the Scottish-English border.The terms Scots-Irish, Scotch-Irish and Ulster-Scots relate to people who left Scotland, settled as part of the Ulster plantation and then moved on to North America.If this all sounds a little politically cynical, it should be said there are many things to celebrate about the links between Scotland and the United States.",Negative

Watch: Timelapse captures rising glacial lakes in Alaska The National Weather Service has issued a warning as glacial water flows into the Mendenhall River.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cq58jxegzndo,"– Several Alaskans are evacuating their homes as rainwater and snowmelt flow downstream from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier. The flooding is caused by the retreat of a smaller glacier near Mendenhall, a consequence of a warming climate, which left behind a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt. Eventually, the accumulated water created enough pressure to break through the Mendenhall Glacier, triggering the flood. The dog's owner wrote on TikTok that the bear broke into her home and was eating her dog's food before Scout discovered the intruder. The storm system that swept through state on Sunday left nearly 40,000 homes without power.",Negative
