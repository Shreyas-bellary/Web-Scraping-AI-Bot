The sunscreen scandal shocking Australia - the world's skin cancer capital It has shaken consumer trust and raised questions about global sunscreen regulation.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzl41rpdqo,"– Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancers in the world and it is estimated that two out of three Australians will have at least one cut out in their lifetime.So when Choice Australia released its damning report in June, it immediately made waves. Independent analysis by a trusted consumer advocacy group has found that several of Australia's most popular, and expensive, sunscreens are not providing the protection they claim to, kicking off a national scandal.There has been a massive backlash from customers, a probe launched by the country's medical watchdog, multiple products pulled from shelves, and questions raised about the regulation of sunscreen around the globe.Ultra Violette's Lean Screen SPF 50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, a facial product that Rach says she used exclusively, was the ""most significant failure"" identified.Other products that did not meet their SPF claims included those from Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Bondi Sands, and the Cancer Council - but they all rejected Choice's findings and said their own independent testing showed their sunscreens worked as advertised.Rach knows there is no way to prove that there is a link between her diagnosis and the brand of sunscreen she relied on.But she said Ultra Violette's response to the scandal was like ""a kick in the guts.""",Negative

"Analysis: What's behind Putin's uncompromising stance on Ukraine war? Moscow's diplomatic success in China, and Trump's lack of action, have emboldened Putin, reports Steve Rosenberg.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m40pv44kgo,"– Vladimir Putin said recently that he could see ""light at the end of the tunnel.""It seems to me that right now Russia on the one hand, and Ukraine and Europe (and to some extent America) on the other are in different tunnels, on different roads, with different destinations.Ukraine and Europe are focused on ending the fighting, shaping security guarantees for Kyiv and making sure that the Ukrainian army is strong enough post-war to prevent another invasion.But in many ways it encapsulates the Kremlin's current position on the war in Ukraine: ""Yes, we want peace, but only on our terms. You reject our terms? No peace then.""This uncompromising stance is being fuelled by a combination of factors.First, by the Kremlin's belief that, in Ukraine, Russian forces have the initiative on the battlefield.Second, by diplomatic success.",Positive

Tesla proposes $1tn award for Musk if he hits targets,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx29qv4nvvo,"– Tesla boss Elon Musk will receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed.To get the package, Musk, who is already the world's richest person, would need to boost Tesla's value eightfold, sell a million artificial intelligence robots, sell another 12 million Tesla cars, and hit several other moonshot goals.Musk would not earn a salary or bonus but would instead be gradually awarded shares which would be worth $1tn if he achieves all the targets.The company's board urged investors to vote in favor of the package.Mr Coatsworth said: ""Is one person worth that much?"" he asked.Mr Coatsworth added that Musk ""presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk's actions outside of Tesla.""He continued: ""Surely Musk should be fighting for his job, not Tesla's board fighting to keep him?""The board's unprecedented pay proposal comes just months after it was forced to deny reports that it was looking to replace Musk.According to Tesla's latest financial report, sales are falling at their fastest rate in a decade, an issue which some experts have put down to Musk's ""toxic"" reputation.Mr Coatsworth said: ""One minute Tesla's board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they're effectively saying 'pick a number, any number' to lock him in for as long as possible.""",Positive
