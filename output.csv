"UK to join major wind farm project with nine European countries For the first time, the new wind farms will be connected to more than one country through undersea cables.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp372d37gxgo,"– The UK is set to back a vast new fleet of offshore wind projects in the North Sea alongside eight other European countries including Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands.The government says the deal will strengthen energy security by offering an escape from what it calls the ""ilfoss fuel rollercoaster.""For the first time, some of the new wind farms will be linked to multiple countries through undersea cables known as interconnectors, which supporters say should lower prices across the region.But it could prove controversial as wind farm operators would be able to shop around between countries to sell power to the highest bidder - potentially driving up electricity prices when supply is tight.
