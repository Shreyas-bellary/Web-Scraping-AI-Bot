"Andrew's move out of Royal Lodge may not happen until new year There are also no plans to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession, the government says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2emmdnw82yo,"– Andrew Mountbatten Windsor will not have to leave Royal Lodge immediately and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year, the BBC understands. On Thursday, King Charles stripped his younger brother of his titles and honors, and moved to force him out of his Windsor mansion.The dramatic statement came after months of pressure over Andrew's private life, as his ties to disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continued to dog the royals. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the government has said it had no plans to pass a law to formally remove Andrew from the line of succession.Andrew will move to an undisclosed property on the privately-owned estate, with the accommodation funded by the King who will also make private financial provisions for his brother.Sandringham was bought in 1862 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VII, as a private country retreat.The controversy around Andrew has been rumbling on for years, but came to a head when he was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.It is understood the move to remove Andrew's titles was taken by the King in light of the serious lapses of judgement his brother made, and that his decision was supported by the wider Royal Family.",Negative
"She's a pop star, he's a former PM - why Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau just might work Both the former Canadian prime minister and the California Girl singer have been through high and lows of public opinion.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09r01k9yqo,"– It is a pairing that few could have predicted: a former prime minister of Canada and an American pop star who has toured the world and reached the edge of space.Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry have made it official. The couple was spotted by paparazzi holding hands in Paris last weekend as they left the Crazy Horse Abroad, where they had been celebrating Perry's 41st birthday.The pairing also offers a rare glimpse into the private life of Trudeau, who became a global progressive icon after he was catapulted into Canada's highest office in 2015, since he was forced to resign from politics earlier this year after his popularity plummeted.The relationship is a ""rebranding for both of them in a very interesting and unexpected way"", said Jose Rodriguez, a professor of Communication Studies at California State University Long Beach.Many observers wondered what the two could have in common but both are recovering from reputational hits in their own ways.Trudeau was elected to a sweeping majority government in 2015, promising ""sunny ways"" and a new era of progressive politics in Canada.Perry, however, is anything but ordinary.",Positive

Hundreds feared dead in Tanzania crackdown on election protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0x8vdvkjgo,"– Hundreds of people have been killed in Tanzania during three days of protests following Wednesday's general election, the country's main opposition party has said.The death toll varies, and a nationwide internet shutdown is making it difficult to verify the numbers.While a spokesperson from the opposition Chadema party told AFP news agency that ""around 700"" people had been killed in clashes with security forces, a diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.The government has sought to play down the scale of the violence—and authorities have extended a curfew in a bid to quell the unrest.The protests have seen mostly young protesters take to the streets in cities across Tanzania to denounce the election as unfair.They accuse the government of undermining democracy by suppressing the main opposition leaders—one is in jail and another was excluded on technical grounds— thus bolstering President Samia Suluhu Hassan's chances of winning with her ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party. Official results are expected on Saturday, but President Samia is expected to win under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party, which has governed the country since independence in 1961.She came to power in 2021 as Tanzania's first female president following the death in office of former President John Magufuli.",Negative
"Egypt's Grand Museum opens, displaying Tutankhamun tomb in full for first time",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4q403rpzo,"– Egypt is officially opening what it intends as a cultural highlight of the modern age.The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), described as the world's largest archaeological museum, is packed with some 100,000 artifacts covering some seven millennia of the country's history from pre-dynastic times to the Greek and Roman eras.Prominent Egyptologists argue that its establishment strengthens their demand for key Egyptian antiquities held in other countries to be returned—including the famed Rosetta Stone displayed at the British Museum.A main draw of the GEM will be the entire contents of the intact tomb of the boy king Tutankhamun, displayed together for the first time since it was found by British Egyptologist Howard Carter.The museum was first proposed in 1992, during the rule of President Hosni Mubarak, and construction began in 2005.It has now taken nearly as long to complete as the Great Pyramid, according to estimates.The project was hit by financial crises, the 2011 Arab Spring—which deposed Mubarak and led to years of turmoil—the Covid 19 pandemic, and regional wars.""It was my dream. I'm really happy to see this museum is finally opened!"" Dr Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former long-time minister of tourism and antiquities, tells me.The new museum is colossal, spanning 500,000 square meters (5.4m sq ft)—about the size of 70 football pitches. Among the GEM showstoppers are a 3,200-year-old, 16m-long suspended obelisk of the powerful pharaoh, Ramesses II, and his massive 11m-high statue.Apart from the Tutankhamun exhibit and a new display of the spectacular, 4,500-year-old funerary boat of Khufu—one of the oldest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity—most of the galleries at the site have been opened to the public since last year.",Positive
