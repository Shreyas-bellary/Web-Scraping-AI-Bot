Trump says EU and Mexico face 30% tariff from August The US president warned both trading partners would face additional tariffs if they retaliated.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvj13d9ylpo,"– President Donald Trump has announced that the European Union and Mexico will face a 30% tariff on imports to the US from 1 August.He warned he would impose even higher import taxes if either of the US trading partners decided to retaliate.The 27-member EU said earlier this week it hoped to agree a deal with Washington before 1 August.Trump has this week also said the US will impose new tariffs on goods from Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil, also starting from 1 August.The letter sent on Friday to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump wrote: ""We have had years to discuss our trading relationship with the European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term-large, and persistent, trade deficits, engendered by your tariff, and non-tariff, policies and trade barriers.""""Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from reciprocal,"" the letter added.Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump added.",Positive
"Mystery of Air India crash deepens after report reveals cockpit audio Fuel cut-off switches were flipped seconds after take-off, a preliminary report finds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gy78gpnqo,"– Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.Just seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the ""cut-off"" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to ""cut-off"" is a move typically done only after landing. The preliminary report from the investigation—led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK—raises several questions.Investigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation—they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s.The recordings were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.Air India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighborhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters.",Negative
"Med Sea heatwave might feel nice for holiday swimming but there's a catch Sea temperatures around places like Majorca exceeded 30C earlier this month, far above average.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2v1l7j6yo,"– ""We're all very, very surprised at the magnitude of this heatwave,"" added Aida Alvera-Azcrate, an oceanographer at the University of Liege in Belgium.""It's a matter of high concern, but this is something we can expect to be happening again in the future."" Marine heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer-lasting as humanity continues to release planet-warming gases into our atmosphere, principally by burning coal, oil and gas.What is different this year is that 30C sea temperatures have arrived much earlier, and that means that we can expect the summer to be more intense and longer,"" said Marta Marcos, associate professor at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain.""I grew up here, so we are used to heatwaves, but this has become more and more common and intense.""The Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable because it's a bit like a bathtub, largely surrounded by continents rather than open ocean.That means water cannot escape easily, so its surface heats up quickly in the presence of warm air, sunny skies and light winds—as happened in June.Seaweeds and seagrasses act a bit like the forests of the Mediterranean Sea, home to hundreds of species, as well as locking up planet-warming carbon dioxide.""Some of them are well adapted to typical Mediterranean warm temperatures, but actually they often cannot withstand marine heatwave conditions, which are becoming more extreme and widespread,"" said Dr Cebrian.The heat can also cause what ecologists call ""sub-lethal effects"", where species essentially go into survival mode and don't reproduce.""If we start to see ecological impacts, there will almost certainly be impacts on human societies [including] losses of fisheries,"" warned Dan Smale, senior research fellow at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth.""I remember four years ago diving in September at the end of summer, we found skeletons of many, many, many, many, many, many populations,"" said Emma Cebrian.",Positive
"Canada's Carney talked tough on Trump - now some say he's backing down Canada has made concessions to win goodwill with the White House. Trump, in return, has threatened steeper tariffs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg81518yyyo,"– It's another curveball in the Canada-US trade war—a new missive by US Donald Trump threatening an unexpected 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting next month. It came as the two countries engage in intense trade talks meant to produce a new deal in the coming days, and what the latest tariff threat means for these negotiations is unclear. But Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, is beginning to face questions over whether he is able to stand up to Trump and secure the fair deal for Canada he promised.Carney won April's general election vowing to keep his ""elbows up"" in the face of US threats, leaning on a popular ice hockey metaphor used to describe an assertive and confrontational style of play.But Canada's recent concessions to Trump appear to have yielded, to date, little result.Trump threatens 35% tariffs on Canadian goodsCanada will deal with Trump 'on our terms', Carney tells BBCThe latest came in late June, when Canada scrapped a Digital Services Tax (DST) it had planned to impose on big tech companies after Trump threatened to end negotiations over the policy.Many US-based manufacturers also rely on Canadian products like steel and aluminum, which are currently subject to a steep 50% tariff.The good news for Canada is that the new tariff rate will not apply—at least for now—to goods under the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, which covers a vast majority of the cross-border trade.President Trump has also sent similar notes to more than 20 countries as part of his plan to carve out new agreements with America's trade partners.Domestically, Canadians across political stripes remain united against Trump's tariffs.",Positive
