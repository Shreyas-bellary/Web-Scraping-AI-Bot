"Carlo Acutis: From a baptism in London to the first millennial saint Before his death at 15, Carlo Acutis was known for his love of technology and had created a website to document miracles.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg5me8dvlo,"– A London-born boy is set to become the first millennial saint, in a ceremony steeped in an ancient ritual presided over by Pope Leo on Sunday.In his short life, Carlo Acutis created websites documenting ""miracles"" as a means of spreading Catholic teaching, leading some to nickname him God's influencer.His canonisation had been due in late April, but was postponed following the death of Pope Francis.More than a million people are estimated to have made a pilgrimage to the Italian hilltop town of Assisi where Carlo's body lies, preserved in wax.While some who knew Carlo Acutis say he did not appear to be especially devout, as a teenager he did create a website— pages of which are now framed at the church in Chelsea—in which miracles were documented.The font at the back of the Roman Catholic church in the Chelsea area was where Carlo was baptised as a baby in 1991.His mother, Antonia Salzano, visited churches around the world to advocate for him to be a saint.Approval for someone to become a saint can take decades or even centuries, but there is a sense that the fast-tracked Carlo Acutis' canonisation as a means of inspiring faith in young people.The Catholic Church will be hoping Sunday's events do just that.",Positive
