Boss of degrading sex-trade ring in Dubai's glamour districts unmasked by BBC Young Ugandan women tell BBC they are being lured to Dubai to take part in extreme sex acts.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r9y3kxy9o,"– The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do ""pretty much everything"" clients want them to.Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.""He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,"" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai.Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish.""Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested.They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run.And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.""Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him.Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations.He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments.Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information.",Negative
Madeleine McCann suspect turns down Met Police interview Christian Brückner is due to be released from prison in Germany in relation to a separate offence.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5qd18y8j5o,"– The prime suspect in the high-profile case of Madeleine McCann's disappearance has declined to be interviewed by the Metropolitan Police, the force has said.The Met said an international letter of request was sent to Christian Brckner, 49, ahead of his imminent release for a separate offense, for him to speak with them which he later rejected.German national Brckner, 49, has never been charged in the McCann case and denies involvement.Madeleine vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007, shortly after she was left sleeping by her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, who went for dinner in a nearby restaurant. Brckner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of an elderly 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005.We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted.It was subsequently refused by the suspect. Brckner spent time in the Praia da Luz area between 2000 and 2017 and had photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.Earlier this year, German prosecutors pointed to evidence suggesting Brckner may have been in the area when Madeleine disappeared.No charges have ever been brought against Brckner in the case of Madeleine, and the full details of the alleged evidence have never been released.",Negative
"After fatal crash, Sikh truck drivers in the US fear blowback Sikh truck drivers say they've experienced an uptick in harassment after a fatal crash thrust them into the national spotlight.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4rmymrl2ro,"– The trucks keep rolling on Highway 99 in California, the route bustling with freight traffic through the Central Valley.Sikhs, a religious minority group from India, have become a large part of America's trucking industry, helping to deliver everything from California strawberries to lumber across the country.But a crash in Florida and its aftermath have sent shivers through the Sikh trucking community that could have economic consequences.There are approximately 750,000 Sikhs in America, and about 150,000 working in the trucking industry, mostly as drivers.The role they play in this essential industry is evident from the names on their trucks' doors - Singh Trucking, Punjab Trucking - to the curry served at rest stops along the west coast, where approximately 40% of all truck drivers are Sikh, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association.Many have limited English skills but years of driving experience.This has put some drivers in a precarious position, as the Trump administration has moved to tighten language requirements for commercial drivers.Raman Singh Dhillon, chief executive officer of North American Punjabi Trucking Association, said many drivers are now afraid of becoming targets.""Sikh drivers are being harassed at truck stops.In some cases, even local law enforcement has been unresponsive,"" he says, adding that immigrant drivers were once hailed as warriors during the pandemic, when supply backlogs made the value of the industry evident.This episode should be treated as a singular, tragic event and not be weaponized to target the entire Sikh community,"" Arjun Sethi said.",Negative

"Charlie Kirk shooting suspect not co-operating with authorities, governor says He adds that ""much more evidence and information"" will become available once charges are filed in the case.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvrw2pgedo,"– Charlie Kirk's alleged killer is ""not co-operating"" with authorities and has not confessed to carrying out the shooting, Utah's governor Spencer Cox has told US media.Suspect Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody some 33 hours after Kirk, a 31-year-old right-wing activist, was shot dead in Orem on Wednesday.Speaking to ABC News, Cox, a Republican, said people around Robinson had been co-operating with the investigation.Cox appeared on various US news outlets on Sunday morning, where he also reiterated concerns regarding social media in the aftermath of Kirk's death.He called Kirk's shooting a ""direct assault on America"" and said Americans needed to ""look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?""Kirk's widow, Erika, on Saturday gave a tearful address in which she thanked first responders for their efforts and vowed that her ""husband's voice will remain.""It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him.""Mr Robinson was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police.Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University at an open-air event held by Turning Point USA - the organization he co-founded - when he was shot and killed.The event was part of the American Comeback Tour, which was a speaking engagement that took him to several college campuses throughout the US.Cox previously told the Wall Street Journal that Mr Robinson, a Utah native, was ""deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology.""All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him,"" he said.",Negative
'My wife died giving birth after Trump cut funding to our clinic' The BBC hears devastating accounts of Afghan mothers and babies dying after US-backed clinics shut.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgqdneev1no,"– When Shahnaz went into labor, her husband Abdul called a taxi to take them to the only medical facility accessible to them.""She was in a lot pain,"" he says.A 20-minute drive away, the clinic was in Shesh Pol village in Afghanistan's north-eastern Badakhshan province.But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed.It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month.It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services.The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands.The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).It doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider program implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.The US insists no one has died because of aid cuts.Shahnaz and her baby's deaths are not recorded anywhere.The US government further added that they had reports stating that at least $11m were ""being siphoned or enriching the Taliban.""This allegation is not true.The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands.",Negative

It is core to our country's values.""But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the color of their skin.""Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect.",Negative
