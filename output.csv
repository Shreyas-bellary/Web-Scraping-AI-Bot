"Jeremy Bowen: 'Thank you, but it's too late': Why some Palestinians aren't convinced by Starmer's promise Some say Britain's decision is an important first step – while others worry it won't make a real difference.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6n0eeqp54o,"– Britain's prime minister Sir Keir Starmer—following France and then in turn followed by Canada—has a plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September is to turn the two-state solution into a real diplomatic plan again, instead of the empty slogan it has become since the Oslo peace process collapsed into bloodshed 25 years ago.A day driving around the West Bank is a salutary reminder of how facts created by Israel to stop that happening have been concreted into the rocky hills and valleys the Palestinians want for a state.The success of the huge national project that Israel started days after it captured the territory in the 1967 Middle East war can be seen in Jewish settlements that now are home to more than 700,000 Israelis.Getting them there is a project that has taken almost 60 years, billions of dollars, and drawn condemnation from friends as well as enemies.It is a violation of international law for an occupier to settle its citizens on the land it has taken.Last year, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory that said the entire occupation was illegal.A day driving around the West Bank is a salutary reminder of how facts created by Israel to stop that happening have been concreted into the rocky hills and valleys the Palestinians want for a state.At the end of May, the defense minister Israel Katz and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that 22 new settlements would be built in the West Bank.Katz said the massive expansion, the biggest in decades, was making a ""strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel and serves as a buffer against our enemies""",Positive

Maxwell has been at the center of controversy surrounding the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files, and the reasons for her transfer from the Florida prison are unclear. While speculation has been rife that Trump may pardon Maxwell, the White House has previously said ""no leniency is being given or discussed.""The facility, FPC Bryant, is located about 100 miles (160km) from the Texas capital of Austin.Like other federal prison camps, inmates at FPC Bryant are housed in dormitories, with a low staff-to-inmate ratio compared to other, more secure federal prisons.Maxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, confirmed the transfer but declined further comment.",Negative
Tech manufacturing has powered Asia - now it's a casualty of Trump's tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykd997kjjo,"– President Trump said his goal was to bring American jobs and manufacturing back to the US, reduce trade deficits and create a more level playing field for American companies competing globally.But after months of negotiations and many countries' refusal to meet America's demands, his strategy has taken a more punitive turn.US companies have been here before. Under Trump's first administration, when he imposed tariffs on Chinese exports, they scrambled to limit their exposure to Beijing, with many shifting production to Vietnam, Thailand and India to avoid higher levies.The details are still hazy, but US firms from Apple to Nvidia will likely be paying more for their supply chains - they source critical components from several Asian countries and assemble devices in the region.Now they are on the hook - for iPhones, chips, batteries, and scores of other tiny components that power modern lives.Apple earns roughly half its revenue by selling iPhones that are manufactured in China, Vietnam and India.Trump says he is batting for Americans with these tariffs, but in a deeply globalised world, US firms and customers could also become casualties.Trump has just leveled a 25% tariff on Indian imports, after Delhi was unable to clinch a deal in time.Other firms chose to re-route their goods bound for the US through Vietnam and Thailand after the tariffs in Trump's first term.It became so common that it was called the ""China+1"" strategy.Trump's unpredictable tariff policy has paralysed businesses.",Negative
