Trump's week in Asia: BBC correspondents on the wins and potential losses Here's what you should know as the US president arrives for a whirlwind week of diplomacy.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d6jnn37l2o,"– US President Donald Trump is arriving in Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Top of the agenda will be trade—an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.Trump lands in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday.He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.The steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.When he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalize a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.But his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.China's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec—the first since 2019—could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.As the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable.Other Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US.The steep tumbles in the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.",Positive
