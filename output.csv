"Protests and US warnings shake Iran at its weakest point in years War with Israel, a battered economy, and the swift loss of allies have left Iran vulnerable in the face of mounting protests.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn564q0vgvxo,"– Iran is no stranger to street protests, but several factors surrounding the current unrest make it very serious. Monday marks the ninth day since demonstrations broke out, yet even four or five days were enough for President Trump to issue a direct warning to Iranian leaders over the treatment of protesters, saying the US was ""locked and loaded."" Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicols Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday.Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed.The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago.Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next.The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979.",Negative
