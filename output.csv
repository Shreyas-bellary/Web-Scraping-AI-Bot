No ceasefire. Nothing tangible to report.The president said that he and Vladimir Putin made ""some great progress"", but with little details about what that might be, it's left to the world's imagination.Trump traveled a long way to only produce such vagaries, even if America's European allies and Ukrainian officials may be relieved he did not offer unilateral concessions or agreements that could have undermined future negotiations.The big question now—one reporters were unable to ask on Friday—is whether Trump will decide to impose his much-threatened new sanctions on Russia as punishment or if he will find a reason to once again push the deadlines farther down the road.The president said that he and Vladimir Putin made ""some great progress"", but with little details about what that might be, it's left to the world's imagination.Trump traveled a long way to only produce such vagaries, even if America's European allies and Ukrainian officials may be relieved he did not offer unilateral concessions or agreements that could have undermined future negotiations.The big question now—one reporters were unable to ask on Friday—is whether Trump will decide to impose his much-threatened new sanctions on Russia as punishment or if he will find a reason to once again push the deadlines farther down the road.",Negative

Ukraine lost around 14,000 soldiers and civilians during this period.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect— cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now.President Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin, Trump has talked instead about territorial swaps.It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows: Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk.European allies also insist on a halt in fighting.European allies also insist on a halt in fighting.President Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine ""could not"" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.",Positive
