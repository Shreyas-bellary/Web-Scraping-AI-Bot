"Trump says he called Putin during Zelensky visit to begin arranging meetings between them The Ukrainian president says Monday's talks have been ""constructive"" as European leaders repeat calls for a ceasefire.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cev28rvzlv1t,"– European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen just tweeted, doubling down on her calls from earlier today to return Ukraine's missing children. ""And that means every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families."" She was responding to a tweet from Donald Trump, who said missing and abducted children worldwide have been an issue of importance to First Lady Melania Trump specifically. The call lasted for 40 minutes, according to the Kremlin Zelensky says they have had ""very good talks"" today about ""sensitive matters including security guarantees"", adding he is ready to meet Putin bilaterally Trump says security guarantees for Ukraine would be ""provided"" by European countries with ""coordination"" by the US",Positive
Key takeaways from Ukraine talks in Washington Ukraine's President Zelensky managed to avoid another disastrous Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp4jggrj2o,"– President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to the White House on Monday to meet US President Donald Trump for fresh talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.Several European leaders also rejigged plans so they could fly to Washington to attend the meeting, days after Trump met Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a summit that failed to result in a ceasefire.Despite optimistic words by Trump and some more lukewarm assessments from his European partners, by Monday evening there were no tangible commitments to security guarantees or concrete steps towards a peace deal.Trump said that following a bilateral between Putin and Zelensky, at a location to be determined, there would be a trilateral where the US president would join the two.The Kremlin has repeatedly turned down the idea of a Putin-Zelensky bilateral.Two weeks ago Moscow argued that the Russian and Ukrainian presidents had no reason to meet until ""after the appropriate distance"" between the positions of the two countries was ""overcome.""It remains to be seen how straightforward it will be to bring two such bitter enemies face-to-face at the negotiating table for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Zelensky has been pushing to meet Putin, although there is no indication the Ukrainian leader thought such a bilateral could bring the conflict closer to an end.On Monday, Trump noted that the six wars he claims to have helped stop since January - including conflicts between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thailand-Cambodia and India-Pakistan - ended without any formal ceasefire in place first.Even if such a meeting came about, there is also the question of what it might achieve when the Russian and Ukrainian demands for ending the war remain so far apart.",Negative
'Ketamine Queen' to plead guilty in Matthew Perry overdose case The American-British dual-national is one of five people who were charged with supplying ketamine to the actor.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62wnp7622po,"– A woman dubbed the ""Ketamine Queen"" has agreed to plead guilty to selling the drugs that ultimately killed Friends actor Matthew Perry.Jasveen Sangha, 42, will plead guilty to five charges in Los Angeles, including one count of distributing ketamine resulting in death or bodily injury, according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors called her Los Angeles home a ""drug-selling emporium"" and found dozens of vials of ketamine during a raid. Perry was found dead in a back yard jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home in October 2023, with an examination finding his death was caused by the acute effects of ketamine. Sangha is one of five people - including medical doctors and the actor's assistant - who US officials say supplied ketamine to Perry, exploiting his drug addiction for profit, and leading to his overdose death.They include: Dr Salvador Plasencia and Dr Mark Chavez, two doctors who sold ketamine; Kenneth Iwamasa, who worked as Perry's live-in assistant and both helped purchase and inject the actor with ketamine; and Eric Fleming, who sold ketamine he'd gotten from Sangha to Perry. Sangha's criminal trial had been pushed several times and currently was scheduled to begin next month. She is expected to appear in federal court in the coming weeks to formally enter her guilty plea as part of the agreement with federal authorities.",Negative
