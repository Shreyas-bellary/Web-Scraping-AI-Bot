Will giving up his titles really make much difference for Andrew?

I'm just angry at my own government.""The drive to transform Lombok is part of a wider effort to lure travelers away from Bali, which has for decades played an outsized role in Indonesia's tourism industry.The state-owned company leading Mandalika's tourism drive, InJourney Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), has secured 2.1 trillion rupiah ($128m; a 40% jump from the year before—still, a far cry from the 6.3 million foreigners who flocked to Bali.)",Positive
