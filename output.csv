"Vaccine to curb chlamydia epidemic decimating koalas approved Thousands of koalas have died from the disease, with some estimates suggesting only 50,000 remain in the wild.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwylp71vnjgo,"– A vaccine which could save Australia's endangered koala population from a rampant chlamydia epidemic has been approved for rollout for the first time.University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) scientists have spent more than a decade developing a jab to curb the spread of the disease, which has decimated wild koala populations across most of eastern Australia.""Some individual wild colonies, where infection rate can be as high as 70%, are edging closer to extinction every day,"" Dr Peter Timms said.With approval from regulators now secured, he said the team hoped for major funding to distribute the vaccine to wildlife hospitals, vet clinics, and koalas in the wild.Dr Timms, who specializes in microbiology, said the single-dose vaccine—without the need for a booster—was the ideal solution to stop the ""rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across wild populations.""This study found [the vaccine] reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%,"" said UniSC's Dr Sam Phillips, who led the research.Koalas infected with chlamydia are usually given antibiotics but the treatment means they cannot digest eucalyptus leaves—their only food source—leading to starvation and sometimes death.The much-loved national icon has faced increasing threats to its wild populations across much of eastern Australia in recent decades, from factors including land clearing, natural disasters, feral pests and urbanisation.",Neutral
Supreme Court to decide if Trump's global tariffs are legal It will amount to the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and his signature economic policy.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd07exzr418o,"– The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on whether the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs are legal. On Tuesday, it said it would review lower court decisions that found the president did not have the legal authority to enact the tariffs, which were brought in through an emergency economic powers act.It will amount to the biggest test of Donald Trump's presidential authority and his signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions in tariffs. The initial tariff challenge was brought by a group of small businesses and a dozen states, on the basis that Trump's invocation of IEEPA to impose the tariffs was unlawful.The 1977 law states that a president can pull a number of economic levers ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy.""When he unveiled his global tariffs, Trump argued that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency.If the Supreme Court sides with lower courts and finds that Trump's IEEPA tariffs are illegal, questions will remain over whether the US will have to pay back billions of dollars that have been gathered by import taxes on products.Trump had criticized the appeals court and its ruling on Truth Social, saying: ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.""",Negative
