"PM divides Israelis and allies with plan to occupy Gaza The Israeli PM says he seeks full control of Gaza, the removal of Hamas and then to transfer governance to another party.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w2q9k4pjo,"– Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans for a new military push in the Gaza Strip have raised warnings from the army leadership, opposition from hostage families, and concerns that more Palestinians will be killed. Netanyahu gave an interview to Fox News in which he said Israel intended to take full control of Gaza to assure Israel's security, remove Hamas from power and enable the transfer of civilian governance to another party, without giving details.But he suggested that Israel did not want to keep the territory.The potential operations, which could take months, would mean the mass displacement of people with the potential to worsen the humanitarian crisis there.Polls suggest most of the Israeli public favors a deal with Hamas for the release of the hostages and the end of the war.The British ambassador to Israel, Simon Walter, said the full occupation of Gaza would be a ""huge mistake"" while also pushing back against US and Israeli allegations that a possible recognition of Palestinian statehood by the UK was a reward for Hamas.The US envoy, Mike Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel, said it was up to the Israeli government to decide whether to fully take over the Strip.",Negative

"Why Trump-Putin talks unlikely to bring rapid end to Ukraine war Even with Trump's direct involvement, Moscow's preconditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine make a swift ending to the bloodshed difficult to reach.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14gkkzvpx8o,"– President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin is set to take place as soon as Friday, but the conflict in Ukraine could be a major issue. Three rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine held at his behest between May and July have failed to bring the two sides any closer to peace, and Trump may hope that taking the situation into his own hands could finally result in a ceasefire.But the gulf between Kyiv and Moscow is so large that even Trump-mediated talks could make it difficult to bridge.In a memorandum presented to the Ukrainians by Russia in June, Moscow outlined its maximalist demands for a ""final settlement"" of the conflict.At the start of his second term in office, Trump appeared to be more aligned with Russia than Ukraine, labeling Zelensky a ""dictator"" and suggesting he was to blame for the war with Russia.At the start of his second term in office, Trump has also refused to say whether he felt the Russian leader had been lying to him over his readiness to move towards a ceasefire.But should the Kremlin eventually agree to a trilateral meeting, Moscow's demands for a ceasefire have proven so intractable that it is unclear what bringing Zelensky and Putin face-to-face might achieve.Trump has also suggested holding a trilateral with Putin and Zelensky.Ukrainian MP Iryna Herashchenko said it was becoming evident that demands for territorial concessions by Ukraine would be made and added being absent from the negotiating table would be ""very dangerous"" for Kyiv.""Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same bold approach from the Russian side,"" Zelensky said on Thursday.",Negative
