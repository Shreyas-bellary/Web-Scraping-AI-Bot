Thousands of Afghans were moved to UK in secret scheme after data breach The existence of the scheme could not be reported until now because of a court injunction.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8zy78787o,"– In February 2022, the personal details of nearly 19,000 people who had applied to move to the UK after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan were leaked.The previous government learned of the breach in August 2023 when some of the details appeared on Facebook.A new resettlement scheme for those on the leaked list was set up nine months later, and has seen 4,500 Afghans arrive in the UK so far. But the existence of the leak and relocations were kept secret after the government obtained a super-injunction stopping it from becoming public. Details of the major data breach, the response, and the number of Afghans granted the right to live in the UK as a result only came to light on Tuesday after a High Court judge ruled the gagging order should be lifted.The leak contained the names, contact details, and some family information of people potentially at risk of harm from the Taliban.The evacuation—which saw 36,000 Afghans moved to the UK—has already been heavily criticized in the years since it was launched, with a 2022 inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Committee finding it was a ""disaster"" and a ""betrayal.""",Negative

"Man who murdered British backpacker Peter Falconio dies Bradley Murdoch, the Australian man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in 2001, has died.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrlg4x8e78o,"– Bradley Murdoch, the Australian man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in 2001, has died from throat cancer.Murdoch, 67, was serving a life sentence at a prison in Alice Springs, in Australia's Northern Territory.In a statement, the Northern Territory Police Force said: ""It is deeply regrettable that Murdoch has died without, as far as we are aware, ever disclosing the location of Peter Falconio's remains."" Murdoch's death will be subject to investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner, officials added.Murdoch pulled up beside Mr Falconio's vehicle claiming to have seen sparks coming from their camper van.Murdoch shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the vehicle, before taking 28-year-old Joanne Lees, Mr Falconio's girlfriend at the time, into his car and binding her wrists with cable ties.Murdoch was also convicted of the attempted kidnap and assault of Ms Lees, also from Yorkshire, who managed to escape by hiding in outback scrub for several hours before she was able to signal for help.Murdoch was 43 when he committed the crimes.During his trial, prosecutors said that Murdoch was likely to have disposed of Mr Falconio's body somewhere in the vast expanse of wilderness between Alice Springs and Broome, a distance of nearly 1,600km (1,000 miles).In 2016, the Northern Territory introduced ""no body, no parole"" legislation, meaning Murdoch would not have been eligible for parole in 2032 if he did not reveal the location of Mr Falconio's body.Murdoch had always maintained his innocence, and unsuccessfully appealed to overturn his convictions twice.",Negative

"How Trump woke me up for surprise interview  - and the key takeaways The US president signalled a new tone on Nato, voiced his respect for Keir Starmer - and showed his reflective side.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg7eg8w98o,"– Donald Trump makes a habit of calling reporters out of the blue. On Monday evening it was my turn.And I'll be frank with you - I was asleep when the White House rang.I'd spent the best part of five days believing there was an outside chance I would get an interview with him, to mark a year since the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania.My reporting from that shooting had made global headlines and probably caught the president's attention.So I judged that perhaps that connection might be a way of securing a presidential interview - pretty rare things for foreign news organisations in the US.On Sunday night I was told I was minutes away from the call so my team and I were standing by ready to record, but it didn't come.By last night, I'd given up on the interview happening and after a long few weeks on the road without a day off, I was exhausted and taking a nap.Then the phone rang.I blearily answered, and the voice of Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt came over the speaker: ""Hi Gary, I'm here with the president, here you go.""I dashed into my living room, scrambling for my digital recorder; the line dropped and I thought I'd lost it.But they came back on the line and I spent almost 20 minutes speaking to Trump about everything from that fateful night in Butler, to his frustrations with Vladimir Putin, to his new-found belief in NATO and to his view of the UK.Here are my five key takeaways from our surprise conversation.",Negative

Israel bombs Syrian forces entering Druze city after sectarian clashes At least 200 people have reportedly been killed since fighting between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted in Suweida on Sunday.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89e3j4e911o,"– Israel says it has bombed Syrian government forces around Suweida, as they entered the predominantly Druze city following two days of deadly sectarian clashes.At least 200 people have been killed since the fighting between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted on Sunday, UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the Suweida area because the government ""intended to use [them] against the Druze.""Syria has condemned Israel's involvement and said the strikes had resulted in the deaths of members of the armed forces and civilians.This is the first time that Syrian government forces have been deployed to Suweida since Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.The fighting between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias in Suweida was reportedly sparked by the robbery and abduction of a Druze merchant on the highway to Damascus last Friday.Israel's defense minister Maj Gen Murhaf Abu Qasra announced a ""complete ceasefire"", saying an agreement had been reached with ""notables and dignitaries"".""Suweida neighborhoods will be under the control of Internal Security Forces as soon as combing operations are completed in order to end the bloodshed and called on all armed groups there to co-operate and hand over their weapons,"" said Suwayda 24.But hours later, influential Druze Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri posted a video calling on Druze fighters to ""resis[t] this brutal campaign by all available means"", accusing government forces of bombarding Suweida city after drones attacked villages at the same time as government forces deployed in nearby areas of eastern Deraa province.",Negative

French PM looks to scrap two public holidays in bold bid to cut national debt,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d02dz6gedo,"– France's Prime Minister Franois Bayrou has proposed cutting two public holidays as part of a 2026 budget proposal to slash overall spending while also increasing defense expenses.Bayrou suggested axing Easter Monday and 8 May, a day that commemorates the Allied victory at the end of World War II in Europe.The budget also needs to factor in President Emmanuel Macron's call for France's defense spending to rise by 3.5bn (£3bn) next year and then by a further 3bn in 2027.But the proposal to cut the two May public holidays was the most eye-catching suggestion. Bayrou runs the risk of having his budget voted down in parliament in the autumn, which could eventually cause his government to collapse.The far-right National Rally (RN) party damned it as an attack on French history and on French workers, while Green party leader Marine Tondelier lamented that the day that commemorated victory against Nazism would no longer be a holiday.Pressed by reporters after his speech, Bayrou said his proposal was ""basic arithmetic.""",Negative
