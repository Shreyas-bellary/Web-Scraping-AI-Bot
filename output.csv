"US sanctions UN expert Francesca Albanese, critic of Israel's Gaza offensive Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked the move to her support for the International Criminal Court (ICC).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70rllxr0kyo,"– The Trump administration is imposing sanctions on the UN Human Rights Council special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, an outspoken critic of Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio linked the move to her support for the International Criminal Court (ICC), some of whose judges have already been sanctioned by the US.Albanese declined to comment to the BBC, but was quoted by Al Jazeera as describing the sanctions as ""mafia style intimidation techniques.""The US took the action after the court last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza, accusations they reject.Rubio said Albanese had shown contempt for the US by writing ""threatening letters"" to several US companies, making what he called unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC prosecutions of the companies and their executives.Albanese has criticized Donald Trump's plan, announced in February, to take over the Gaza Strip and displace its residents elsewhere.""It's unlawful, immoral and... completely irresponsible because it will make the regional crisis even worse,"" she said in February.Albanese has long argued that Western governments are not doing enough to support the rights of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories.Her outspoken stance has attracted significant support among those who accuse Israeli and US leaders of weaponising accusations of antisemitism in order to silence scrutiny of their policies.Earlier this month Albanese called on dozens of multinational companies to stop doing business with Israel, warning them they risked being complicit in war crimes in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",Negative
'I can't drink the water' - life next to a US data centre Residents in rural Georgia say the data centre next door has disrupted their water supply.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o,"– When Beverly Morris retired in 2016, she thought she had found her dream home—a peaceful stretch of rural Georgia, surrounded by trees and quiet.Today, it's anything but.Just 400 yards (366m) from her front porch in Fayette County sits a large, windowless building filled with servers, cables, and blinking lights.It's a data center—one of many popping up across small-town America, and around the globe, to power everything from online banking to artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.""I can't live in my home with half of my home functioning and no water,"" Ms Morris says.She believes the construction of the center, which is owned by Meta (the parent company of Facebook), disrupted her private well, causing an excessive build-up of sediment.Ms Morris now hauls water in buckets to flush her toilet.She says she had to fix the plumbing in her kitchen to restore water pressure.But the water that comes of the tap still has residue in it.""I'm afraid to drink the water, but I still cook with it, and brush my teeth with it,"" says Morris.Meta, however, says the two aren't connected.The company commissioned an independent groundwater study to investigate Morris' concerns.While Meta disputes that it has caused the problems with Ms Morris' water, there's no doubt, in her estimation, that the company has worn out its welcome as her neighbor.""Our goal is that by 2030, we'll be putting more water back into the watersheds and communities where we're operating data centers, than we're taking out,"" says Will Hewes, global water stewardship lead at Amazon Web Services (AWS), which runs more data centers than any other company globally.",Negative

Steve Rosenberg: Moscow shrugs off Trump's irritation with Putin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epr9y0e84o,"– President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff was a frequent visitor to Russia for talks with President Putin.It seemed as if Moscow and Washington were destined to forge a new relationship.But it's been more than two months since Witkoff's last visit.And, to borrow a Trumpian expression, Vladimir Putin clearly believes that 'he holds the cards' right now and can hold out for a better deal.Is he right? Or is Moscow miscalculating? The Kremlin was trying, at least, to sound diplomatic.Only a week ago Russian commentators were celebrating the US government's decision to strengthen sanctions against Russia.The US and Russia had launched bilateral talks to boost their relations.What's more, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff was a frequent visitor to Russia for talks with President Putin.Trump's way of talking is generally quite harsh... we plan to continue our dialogue with Washington to mend our broken bilateral relations... we hope that Trump and his team will continue their efforts to get the peace process back to the realm of diplomacy.""The Kremlin was trying, at least, to sound diplomatic.But keep in mind my caveat.And that vivid image, in Komsomolskaya Pravda, of Donald Trump changing his shoes.Only a week ago Russian commentators were celebrating the US government's decision to strengthen sanctions against Russia.""The Kremlin believes that Trump offers Russia too little and, therefore, the continuation of a 'bad peace' from the point of view of Russia's long-term national interests,"" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets today.",Positive
