The White House says they are an attempt to ""smear"" the president.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rj0d97ynvo,"– President Trump was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.Within hours, House Republicans then released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to ""cherry-pick"" documents. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were ""selectively leaked"" by House Democrats to ""liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.""The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,"" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested.The first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein goes on to write that Trump ""has never once been mentioned"", including by a ""police chief.""Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, ""either on air or in scrum afterwards.""The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year.",Negative

And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.But others came to its defense, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it ""a nod to the history of Apple.""This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs,"" he said.""But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty.""",Neutral
