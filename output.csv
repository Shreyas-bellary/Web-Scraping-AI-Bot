It's not going to happen.""Trump, who will meet Netanyahu on Monday, also said a Gaza deal was ""pretty close."" Israel is facing increasing global pressure to end the war in Gaza and occupation of the West Bank as a wave of Western states formally recognize an independent Palestinian state.ultranationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeated calls for Israel to annex the West Bank, part of the Palestinian territories, outright.The UK and Germany say they have warned Israel against annexation, while UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres said at the UN on Monday it would be ""morally, legally and politically intolerable.""Trump met on Tuesday at the United Nations with the leaders of key Arab and Muslim nations who warned him of consequences if Israel moved ahead with annexation.""I think the president of the US understands very well the risks and dangers of annexation in the West Bank,"" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told reporters.",Negative
"Trump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinets The US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjreprp3po,"– President Trump announced a new wave of tariffs on Thursday, including a 100% levy on imported branded drugs, unless a firm is building a manufacturing plant in the US.Washington will also impose a 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks and 50% levies on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, he said as he announced a slew of industry-focused duties on his Truth Social platform.""The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,"" Trump wrote, citing the need to protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.Earlier this year, the US Chamber of Commerce urged the White House against introducing new tariffs, arguing that many parts used in truck production are sourced ""overwhelmingly"" from countries like Mexico, Canada, Germany, Finland and Japan.The organization added that these countries are ""allies or close partners of the United States posing no threat to US national security.""Mexico and Canada are among the biggest suppliers of parts for medium and heavy-duty trucks, accounting for more than half of total US imports in the sector last year, said the chamber.It warned that it is ""impractical"" to expect many of these parts to be sourced domestically, resulting in higher costs for the industry.Trump's sweeping new tariffs on more than 90 countries came into effect in early August, as part of his policies aimed at boosting jobs and manufacturing in the US, among other political goals.The announcements come despite calls from US businesses for the White House to not impose further tariffs.",Positive
Trump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35s The US president suggests the US could lift sanctions on Turkey and allow it to buy F-35 jets.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jm3lr7vkyo,"– President Trump has urged Turkey to stop buying oil from Russia, part of a wider drive to cut off Moscow's energy funding as the war in Ukraine rages on.Speaking alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House, Trump said halting those imports would be ""the best thing"" his Turkish counterpart could do.The Oval Office meeting ended without any firm commitments to lift US sanctions on Turkey or sell advanced F-35 fighter jets, although Trump expressed optimism about both issues.Turkey has for years been prevented from buying US F-35s. In a brief question-and-answer session alongside Erdogan in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he would like Turkey to stop ""buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues its rampage against Ukraine.""The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,"" Trump said.Trump added that he believes Erdogan is respected both by Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meaning that he could ""have a big influence"" on the war ""if he wants to.""The US president's comments come just weeks after he said he stood poised to impose tougher sanctions on Russia if NATO countries met conditions that included halting imports of Russian oil.",Positive
China launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internet Pessimistic social media posts may now be targets of a fresh crackdown by the Chinese government.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39r7p47wzgo,"– The Chinese government is taking aim at an emotion that has become all too common on the country's internet—despondency.This week, China's Cyberspace Administration launched a two-month campaign to curb social media posts that ""excessively exaggerate negative and pessimistic sentiments.""In the crosshairs are narratives like ""studying is useless"" and ""hard work is useless"", as well as stories that promote ""world-weariness.""China has been grappling with an economic slowdown in the wake of a property crisis, high youth unemployment and cut-throat competition for admission to colleges and jobs—all of which have given rise to a sense of disillusionment among its younger generation.Young people in China ""have serious questions about future prospects of their lives"" and ""must confront the fact that their livelihood is very likely going to be worse than their parents' generation,"" Simon Sihang Luo, an assistant professor of social sciences at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, tells the BBC.But any attempts to keep China's cyberspace unnaturally sunny is sure to come at a cost.""The expression of sentiments doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental rejection of participating in the labor market and society at large,"" says Dr Luo.Last week, well-known content creator Hu Chenfeng had his social media accounts scrubbed of all posts.",Negative
"Ratmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our cities Rats are multiplying at speed in urban areas. So, what's really behind the boom - and is it now unstoppable?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvk397j80o,"– It's not just affecting the UK. Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto. Though they're not inherently dirty animals, rats scavenge in sewers and bins and can pass on serious diseases to humans.Rats live in drains, sewers and burrows, and emerge mostly at night, counting them is nearly impossible, so estimates on rat population figures vary.In the UK it could be anywhere from 10 million to 120 million.What is known is that more than half a million rat infestations were reported to UK councils, between 2023 and the middle of this year, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by drainage repair company, Drain Detectives.Rat numbers are reported to have spiked in several US cities too, including Washington DC, San Francisco and New York City, as well as in Amsterdam and Toronto.Bobby Corrigan calls himself an urbanologist.He started out as an exterminator in New York City and has spent his life immersed in rats.Years later, while studying rats in college, he went to extreme lengths to understand their behaviours - once he slept on the floor of a rat-infested barn to observe it first hand.His study examined 16 cities, mostly in North America, and the results, published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year, found that 11 of them recorded significant increases in rat activity over a period of between seven and 17 years.In Washington DC the increase was almost 400%, in San Francisco it was 300%, Toronto 180% and New York City.The British Pest Control Association (BPCA) says more than half of the pest control companies who are members have seen an increased number of rat callouts over the last five years.",Positive
"Drone attacks leave Denmark exposed - and searching for response In an era of hybrid warfare, there is a sense of embarrassment that Denmark's critical infrastructure has become vulnerable.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g96gvql99o,"– A night of drone incidents at airports and military bases all over Jutland, western Denmark, has not caused any harm or damage—and yet it has exposed the country's defenses as vulnerable to attack.In an era of hybrid warfare, there is a sense of embarrassment in Denmark—a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) alliance—that its critical infrastructure has become so vulnerable.Police in Jutland did say they would try to bring down the drones if it could be done safely, and the military has made clear it is prepared to do so over military installations, dependent on ""the specific threat assessment and possible consequences of the takedown.""I wouldn't shoot down the drones if they are over an urban area or an airport,"" he says, ""as they have to come down, and there'd be other fuel or batteries creating a fire, which is also a risk you have to take into account.""From an engineering perspective it's so much easier to build a drone that can fly than to build something that can keep them from flying,"" Jensen, from the University of South Denmark, points out.The government recently announced plans for an ""integrated layered air defense"", along with investment in long-range precision weapons to hit enemy territory.But that's of little use for Denmark's defenses right now.""From an engineering perspective it's so much easier to build a drone that can fly than to build something that can keep them from flying,"" Jensen, from the University of South Denmark, points out.Denmark's cautious approach is markedly different from Poland's since Russia's drone incursions there on 10 September.Estonia and Poland have both invoked NATO's Article 4 this month after Russian war planes entered Estonian air space for 12 minutes, and about 20 Russian drones violated Polish airspace and were shot down.",Negative
"Million-year-old skull rewrites human evolution, scientists claim New analysis suggests our species began to emerge at least half a million years earlier than we thought",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx01ve5151o,"– A million-year-old human skull found in China suggests that our species, Homo sapiens, began to emerge at least half a million years earlier than we thought, researchers are claiming in a new study.It also shows that we co-existed with other sister species, including Neanderthals, for much longer than we've come to believe, they say.When scientists found the skull, named Yunxian 2, they assumed it belonged to an earlier ancestor of ours, Homo erectus, the first large-brained humans.But other experts in a field where disagreement over our emergence on the planet is rife, say that the new study's conclusions are plausible but far from certain.The earlier timeline means that the three species of humans co-existed on the planet for around 800,000 years, much longer than previously thought, perhaps interacting and interbreeding in that time.The earliest known evidence for early Homo sapiens in Africa is 300,000 years ago, so it is tempting to conclude that our species might have evolved first in Asia.The earlier emergence also helps make sense of dozens of human fossil remains dating from 800,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago that scientists have found hard to classify and find their place in the human family tree—the so-called ""muddle in the middle.""Human evolution is like a tree,"" he said.This startling analysis has dramatically shifted the timeline of the evolution of large-brained humans back by at least half a million years, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, a co-lead on the research.",Positive
Dallas shooter intended target to be ICE not detainees - officials,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgel2516zpo,"– FBI director Kash Patel said in a post on social media earlier that evidence ""to this point indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning.""Patel said one of the handwritten notes found said: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?"" At the news conference on Thursday, Larson said the shooter ""very likely acted alone"".""That morning gunshots sprayed the length of the building, the windows, and law enforcement vans that were in the sallyport area,"" she said, adding detainees were hit.The notes were found at the shooter's residence, and included a ""gameplan of the attack"", she said.It seems that he did not intend to kill the detainees or harm them.One detainee was killed and two others critically injured after a suspected sniper opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center in Dallas on Wednesday.The suspected shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, law enforcement officials said.",Negative
Microsoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjx0zve2no,"– Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit of Israel's Ministry of Defense after an investigation found its technology had been used to conduct mass surveillance on people in Gaza. Brad Smith, president of the company, said using the firm's technology to conduct mass surveillance on civilians was a violation of its standard terms of service. Microsoft's work with the Israeli government has been a controversial issue, including within the company, prompting protests by employees. ""I know many of you care about this topic,"" Mr Smith wrote in a message to staff that was published by the company on Thursday. He emphasised that the review was ongoing: ""I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so."" Last month's investigation by the Guardian, which collaborated with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, found that a unit of the Israeli defense ministry used the expansive storage capacity of Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, to create a giant trove of calls made by ordinary Palestinians that it had intercepted. Microsoft, which has responded to protests from staff over its work for Israel by firing some employees, said it launched its own review in response to the article.
