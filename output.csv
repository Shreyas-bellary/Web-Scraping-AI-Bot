"EU and US agree trade deal, with 15% tariffs for European exports to America US President Donald Trump and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen shake on it after ""tough negotiations"" in Scotland.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o,"– The United States and European Union have reached a trade deal framework, ending a months-long standoff between two of the world's biggest economic partners.After make-or-break negotiations between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in Scotland, the pair agreed a US tariff on all EU goods of 15%. Trump said the 27-member bloc would open its markets to US exporters with zero per cent tariffs on certain products.Von der Leyen also hailed the deal, saying it would bring stability for both allies, who together account for almost a third of global trade.Trump - who is on a five-day visit to Scotland - said following their brief meeting: ""We have reached a deal. It's a good deal for everybody.""It was notable that Von der Leyen spoke about ""rebalancing"" the trading relationship.The US president will be in Aberdeen on Tuesday, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next week.The Irish Prime Minister, the Taoiseach Michel Martin, noted the fact that tariffs would still be higher than before, making trade ""more expensive and more challenging.""It came after the US president finished 18 holes at the Turnberry resort with guests and family, including his son Eric, amid showery conditions.",Positive
"Both sides can claim victory in US-EU tariff deal, but devil may be in detail This deal shows how serious President Trump is about renegotiating America's trading relationship with the rest of the world.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpdv5x54ko,"– After weeks of tense negotiations between their top trade officials, the EU and US have finally struck a deal—and it comes on the eve of America's latest round of tariff talks with China.Ultimately it took leaders from Washington and Brussels to sit down face to face to reach Sunday's agreement.This deal is being sold as a landmark moment in relations between the US and the EU.It has not been easy getting to this point.Washington and the 27-nation bloc have both played hardball and neither was ready to give in easily, which is why these talks went down to the wire.The other complaint has been that the EU's strict regulations on everything from cars to chickens make it harder for American companies to sell their products in the EU than the other way round.This deal shows how serious President Trump is about renegotiating how the US, the world's biggest economy, does business with everyone else.Given the EU consists of 27 very different countries, it has seemed one of the trickier trade agreements to pull off.It comes days after the US struck another major agreement with Japan—there have also been deals with the UK, Vietnam and Indonesia.The other big ones still on the table are with the three biggest US trade partners—Mexico, Canada and China.",Negative

"American musical satirist Tom Lehrer dies at 97, US media report Lehrer, a Harvard-trained mathematician, wrote darkly humorous songs, often with political connotations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv02yd2714o,"– American musician and satirist Tom Lehrer has died at the age of 97, according to US media reports. Lehrer, a Harvard-trained mathematician, wrote darkly humorous songs, often with political connotations, that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s.Modern comedians such as Weird Al Yankovich said they have been influenced by Lehrer's work.His death was confirmed to the New York Times by David Herder, a friend.Born in Manhattan in 1928, Lehrer was a classically trained pianist.But despite his musical success, he spent most of his life pursuing academia.He was renowned for his darkly comic ballads, including the necrophiliac epic I Hold Your Hand in Mine, I Got It From Agnes—where he sang about the transmission of a venereal disease—and Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, which detailed the birds' apparent appetite for ""peanuts coated with cyanide.""He wrote for the 1970s educational children's show, The Electric Company, and in 1980 his songs enjoyed a revival when theater producer Cameron Mackintosh staged the musical revue featuring his work.He also taught math and musical theater courses at the University of California from 1972 to 2001, according to the New York Times.",Negative
"Malnutrition in Gaza at alarming levels, WHO warns as aid airdrops resume Israel's concession to aid come as it faces growing international pressure to alleviate mass starvation in Gaza.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj270grkxo,"– The World Health Organization has warned malnutrition has reached ""alarming levels"" in Gaza with rates on a ""dangerous trajectory"", after aid airdrops resumed in the Strip. Jordan said it had worked with the United Arab Emirates and dropped 25 tons of aid into Gaza on Sunday after Israel began what it called a ""tactical pause"" in fighting.Israel had said it would halt military operations for 10 hours a day in parts of Gaza and allow aid corridors for UN convoys, to ""refute the false claim of intentional starvation.""This is progress,"" he said, ""but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis.""On Sunday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had airdropped seven packages of aid consisting of flour, sugar, and canned food.However, medics reported nine killed and 54 injured by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route in central Gaza.The BBC geolocated an airstrike to Midhat Al-Wahidy Street in Al-Rimal district of western Gaza City - which Israel had designated an hour before as an area where operations would cease.Israel has denied targeting aid-collecting civilians.US President Trump said he would be sending more aid to Gaza, but added this was ""an international problem - it's not a US problem.""These measures must be fully implemented and further barriers on aid removed.The IDF said its troops ""fired warning shots"" at a ""gathering of suspects"" approaching them.",Negative
The rise of Japan's far right was supercharged by Trump - and tourists A once obscure far-right party has become a serious contender in Japan's political scene.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k29233jeo,"– Japanese politics is a usually steady ship, verging on the boring most of the time.Not anymore.Last Sunday, a once obscure far-right party, Sanseito, surged from one to 15 seats in the elections, making them a serious contender in Japan's political scene.With their ""Japanese First"" slogan, riffing off US President Donald Trump's ""America First,"" they have truly ruffled the feathers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its embattled prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba.For him, the last week was something of a rollercoaster.In the election, his ruling LDP coalition lost their majority in the upper house of Japan's parliament - having already lost control of the lower house last year - prompting calls for his resignation from his own party. By Wednesday, he had sealed a deal on tariffs with the US, which the US president called ""massive."" Another parallel with Trump's Republicans, as well as other right-wing movements and parties across the world, is the focus on immigration.Japan has historically had very low levels of immigration but it has been on the rise.The number of foreign residents living in Japan at the end of last year was approximately 3.77 million - an increase of almost 11% from the previous year, and a new record high.Japan's population is aging fast, and many argue that the country needs migrants to work, pay taxes, and take care of the ballooning numbers of elderly people.But others feel differently. Sanseito blames the government for policies that have allowed more foreigners into the country.The agriculture minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has vowed to bring prices down and to modify the supply chain but prices remain high.",Positive
Google failed to warn 10 million people of Turkey earthquake The tech giant said only 469 serious warnings were sent out ahead of the 7.8 magnitude quake.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77v2kx304go,"– Ten million people within 98 miles of the epicentre could have been sent Google's highest level alert—giving up to 35 seconds of warning to find safety. Instead, only 469 ""Take Action"" warnings were sent out for the first 7.8 magnitude quake.Google told the BBC half a million people were sent a lower level warning, which is designed for ""light shaking"", and does not alert users in the same prominent way. Google's system, named Android Earthquake Alerts (AEA), is able to detect shaking from a vast number of mobile phones that use the Android operating system.Because earthquakes move relatively slowly through the earth, a warning can then be sent out.Google's most serious warning is called ""Take Action"", which sets off a loud alarm on a user's phone—over Do Not Disturb setting—and covering their screen.AEA also has a less serious ""Be Aware"" warning, designed to inform users of potential lighter shaking—a warning that does not override a device on Do Not Disturb.The Take Action alert was especially important in Turkey due to the catastrophic shaking and because the first earthquake struck at 04:17, when many users would have been asleep.After the earthquake Google's researchers changed the algorithm, and simulated the first earthquake again.This time, the system generated 10 million Take Action alerts to those at most risk—and a further 67 million Be Aware alerts to those living further away from the epicentre.""Every earthquake early warning system grapples with the same challenge—tuning algorithms for large magnitude events,"" Google told the BBC.",Negative
The ancient site that has become a political flashpoint in India,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq443xypjo,"– India's first major civilization—the Indus Valley—emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 BCE and the 6th Century BCE.After its decline, the Gangetic plains period rose until the 6th Century BCE.But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.""People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to the period of taking place in Keeladi in the same time it was taking place in Keeladi to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Tamil Brahmi script,"" Mr Kumar says.It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilization is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],"" he says.Since the Indus Valley Civilisations discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilization's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible without the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.The politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep north-south divide—underscoring how understanding the present requires with the past.",Positive
