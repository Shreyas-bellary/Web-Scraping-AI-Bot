"US axes website for reporting human rights abuses by US-armed foreign forces The Human Rights Reporting Gateway acted as a formal ""tip line"" to the US government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx30vnwd4do,"– The US State Department has removed an online portal for reporting alleged human rights violations by foreign military units supplied with American weapons.The Human Rights Reporting Gateway (HRG) acted as a formal ""tip line"" to the US government.It was the only publicly accessible channel of its kind for organizations or individuals to inform it directly of potentially serious abuses by US-armed foreign forces.The department has previously said its restructure made it leaner and more efficient and followed President Trump's 'America First' foreign policy which sees some human rights promotion as ideologically driven.Charles Blaha, former Director of the Office of Security and Human Rights at the State Department, said people in the field would now have ""no established channel"" for reporting gross violations of human rights by foreign security forces.The US is the world's biggest contributor of military aid to foreign countries, supplying funding, equipment, training and arms to more than 150 nations.Its vetting procedures to prevent arms going to units involved in breaches of international law have evolved over the years, with the 1997 legislation named after Senator Leahy being one its major pillars.Tim Rieser, former senior aide to Senator Leahy who wrote the 2011 amendment mandating information gathering, told the BBC the gateway's removal meant the State Department was ""clearly ignoring the law.""",Negative

Myanmar's army is taking back territory with relentless air strikes - and China's help China has thrown its weight behind the junta - and its widely condemned plan to hold an election in December.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051m0jn392o,"– When insurgents finally gained control of the town of Kyaukme—on the main trade route from the Chinese border to the rest of Myanmar—it was after several months of hard fighting last year.Kyaukme straddles Asian Highway 14, more famous as the Burma Road during World War II, and its capture by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) was seen by many as a pivotal victory for the opposition.It suggested that the morale of the military junta which had seized power in 2021 might be crumbling.This month, though, it took just three weeks for the army to recapture Kyaukme.The fate of this little hill town is a stark illustration of how far the military balance in Myanmar has now shifted, in favor of the junta.Kyakme has paid a heavy price.When an alliance of three ethnic armies in Shan State launched their campaign against the military in October 2023—calling it Operation 1027—armed resistance to the coup had been going on in much of the country for more than two years, but making little progress.That changed with Operation 1027.""Two things were overstated at the start of this conflict,"" says Morgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.""The three Shan insurgent groups had a long history of working together.When other groups saw their success in 2023, they then synchronised their own offensives, but this was misreading as some sort of unified, nationwide opposition towards victory.""There is heavy fighting going on every day, in Kyaukme and Hsipaw,"" Tar Parn La, a spokesman for the TNLA, told the BBC earlier this month.Since the military has also retaken it.",Positive

But the rally faded after a volatile day of trading, and the stock ended down roughly 1%, to close at roughly $3.60.Momentum started to build last week, when a Reddit user helped fuel a wave of purchases, drawing comparisons to other rallies of so-called meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC.The gains continued after Roundhill Investments on Monday added the company to the bucket of companies owned by its meme stock ETF, or exchange-traded fund.The business has been struggling with sluggish sales—and has not posted a quarterly profit in more than five years—as shoppers turn away from its meat alternatives.The surge has reignited debate whether the activity, propelled in part by online enthusiasm among everyday investors, is a sign of an overly frothy stock market.",Negative
