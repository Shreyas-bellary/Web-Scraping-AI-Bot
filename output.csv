"White House hits back at reports Trump named in Epstein files Reports that Trump's name appears with many others in justice department files are ""fake news"", says the White House.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyq921zqqzo,"– The White House has pushed back against reports that President Donald Trump is among hundreds of people whose names appear in justice department documents relating to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The claims were ""nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media"", a White House spokesman said.It comes as a US judge denied the justice department's bid to unseal material relating to Epstein from court proceedings in Florida.Trump was once friendly with Epstein before they fell out in 2004—two years before Epstein was first arrested.Last week, the president was asked by a reporter whether the attorney general had told him his name was in the files.Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, called the report ""nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.""The Justice Department called the report a ""collection of falsehoods and innuendo"" designed to push a narrative and get clicks. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in a routine briefing at the White House in February that the files contained hearsay about many people, including Trump, who had socialised with Epstein in the past, according to the newspaper.Bondi also said he did take his own life in a New York jail in 2019—despite conspiracies over his death.The statement came after Bondi had previously suggested she would reveal major disclosures in the case, saying she had ""a lot of names"" and ""a lot of flight logs.""As for the congressional subpoena, Ms Maxwell is taking this one step at a time,"" he added.""She looks forward to her meeting with the Department of Justice, and that discussion will help inform how she proceeds.""House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell could not be trusted to provide accurate testimony.",Positive

And in 2018, a couple tied the knot at a flooded church in Bulacan province, just north of Manila.The submerged weddings aren't just a tale of determination - they are the latest example of a festering flood problem that continues to bring misery to millions, a problem exacerbated by decaying sewage systems, poor urban planning, and extreme weather events that are growing more intense and frequent.",Negative

Top UN court says countries can sue each other over climate change,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce379k4v3pwo,"– A landmark decision by a top UN court has cleared the way for countries to sue each other over climate change, including over historic emissions of planet-warming gases.But the judge at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands on Wednesday said that untangling who caused which part of climate change could be difficult.The ruling is non-binding but legal experts say it could have wide-ranging consequences.It will be seen as a victory for countries that are very vulnerable to climate change, who came to court after feeling frustrated about lack of global progress in tackling the problem.The unprecedented case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was the brainchild of a group of young law students from low-lying Pacific islands on the frontlines of climate change, who came up with the idea in 2019.Many poorer countries had backed the case out of frustration, claiming that developed nations are failing to keep existing promises to tackle the growing problem.The court's opinion is advisory, but previous ICJ decisions have been implemented by governments, including when the UK agreed to hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius last year.""With today's authoritative historic ruling, the International Court of Justice has broken with business-as-usual and delivered a historic affirmation: those suffering the impacts of climate devastation have a right to remedy for climate harm, including through compensation,"" said barrister Jennifer Robinson at Doughty Street Chambers, who represented Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands.It is not clear how much an individual country could have to pay in damages if any claim was successful.",Negative
