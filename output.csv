"Trump's global tariffs 'victory' may well come at a high price The US President considers it a win - but if this all triggers a foundational realignment, the results may not break in his favour",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l6g13rlwko,"– In April Donald Trump stunned the world by announcing sweeping new import tariffs—only to put most on hold amid the resulting global financial panic.Four months later, the US president is touting what he claims are a series of victories, having unveiled a handful of deals with trading partners and unilaterally imposed tariffs on others, all without the kind of massive disruptions to the financial markets that his spring attempt triggered.At least, so far.Having worked to reorder America's place in the global economy, Trump is now promising that the US will reap the benefits of new revenue, rekindle domestic manufacturing, and generate hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment and purchases.Whether that turns out to be the case—and whether these actions will have negative consequences—is still very much in doubt.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe.Trump may have hailed the size of the agreement of the US with the EU—but these are not the tariff-busting deals we equated with tearing down trade barriers in previous decades.The greatest fears, the warnings of potential disaster, have not been realized.Second, the agreement of tariff terms, however unpalatable, reduced much of the uncertainty (itself wielded by Trump as a powerful economic weapon) for better - and for worse.What is clear so far, however, is that a tide that was (gently) turning on free trade, even ahead of Trump's second term, has become a wave crashing across the globe.",Positive

"Shock, chaos and a hollow win: Chasing a tariff deal with Trump It's been a fraught process for many countries - with little detail about what exactly has been agreed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cger99z0yp9o,"– President Trump's tariff announcement on 2 April, nowhere was the shock greater than in South East Asia, a region whose entire world view and economic model is built on exports.The levies went as high as 49% on some countries, hitting a range of industries from electronics exporters in Thailand and Vietnam to chip makers in Malaysia and clothing factories in Cambodia.""I remember waking up in the morning. It was quite early, and seeing him standing there on the White House lawn with his board.According to the US president, the deal cuts the tariffs to 20%, while he claims Vietnam will now impose no tariffs at all on any imports from the US.The other difficulty facing the Thai trade team was what the US was asking for in return for cutting the tariff rate, in particular access to Thailand's agricultural market, which is heavily protected.Thailand, which was facing a 36% levy, now has a deal, like most of its neighbours, to reduce the tariffs to 19%. Vietnam is by far the most exposed economy, its exports to the US totalling $137bn, making up about 30% of its GDP.The other difficulty facing the Thai trade team was what the US was asking for in return for cutting the tariff rate, in particular access to Thailand's agricultural market, which is heavily protected.It has been a fraught process getting there, and there is still very little detail about exactly what has been agreed.",Negative

"US to deny visas to Palestinian officials The US says both the PLO and the Palestinian Administration continue to support ""terrorism"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ryjpjrvddo,"– The US says it is going to impose sanctions on the Palestinians' self-governance organization as well as the body that represents it on the international stage.The sanctions affect both the Palestinian Authority (PA) which was established by the Oslo peace accords, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) which was recognized after the same process as the official representative of the Palestinian people in return for it recognizing Israel and renouncing violence.The State Department said it would deny visas to PLO members and PA officials.The US castigated these moves, having privately warned of diplomatic consequences if those attending the UN conference made ""anti-Israel"" declarations.It also referred to a series of long-standing complaints by the US and Israel that the PLO and PA had continued ""to support terrorism including glorification and incitement of violence (especially in textbooks), and providing payments and benefits in support of terrorism to Palestinian terrorists and their families.""This important action by [President Trump] and his administration also exposes the moral distortion of certain countries that ran to recognize a virtual Palestinian state while turning a blind eye to its support for terror and incitement,"" said foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar.",Negative
Radioactive wasp nest found at old US nuclear weapons site,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dpxr85228o,"– A radioactive wasp nest with radiation levels 10 times of what is allowed under regulations was found at a facility that once produced parts for US nuclear weapons, federal officials said.""The wasp nest was sprayed to kill wasps, then bagged as radiological waste,"" says a US Department of Energy report released last week.Investigators say the contamination is not related to a nuclear waste leak, and that there was no impact to ""the environment, or the public.""The wasp nest was discovered by workers who routinely inspect for nuclear radiation at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, on 3 July.It was found on a post nearby to where millions of gallons of liquid nuclear waste are stored, but there was no leak from the waste tanks, the report said.Investigators attribute the dangerously-high levels found on the nest to what is called ""onsite legacy radioactive contamination"" - the residual radioactivity that remains from the time when the site was actively producing parts for nuclear bombs during the Cold War.The site opened in the 1950s, when it was creating plutonium to be used in the core of nuclear bombs.It continues to operate today, but with a focus on nuclear material for power plants.The energy department report notes that the wasps that lived within the nest would have significantly lower radiation levels than the nest itself.",Negative
