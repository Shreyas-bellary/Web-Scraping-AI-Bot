Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship The deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford marks a major escalation in what the US says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891gzx7xn4o,"– Venezuela's President Nicols Maduro has accused the US of ""fabricating a war"", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.""They are fabricating a new eternal war,"" Maduro told state media.Maduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organization which he denies.The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.It has also carried out 10 airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said ""six male narco-terrorists"" had been killed.The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance.Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.It is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.The carrier's deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.",Negative
"Warships, fighter jets and the CIA - what is Trump's endgame in Venezuela? President Trump says he wants to tackle the drugs trade but many believe he is trying to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp2lxz75eo,"– The US has upped its bounty for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m, an incentive for those within his loyal, inner circle to hand him in.But it has yielded no defections.Venezuelan law professor and senior associate at the CSIS national security think tank, Jose Ignacio Hernndez, says $50m is ""nothing"" for Venezuela's elites.He argues the military build-up is a show of strength intended to ""strike fear"" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry ""narcotics"" and ""narco-terrorists"", without providing evidence or details about those on board.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality.It is no secret that the US administration, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would like to see Maduro toppled.Earlier this year, he told Fox News Maduro was a ""horrible dictator"" and when asked whether he was demanding that Maduro leave, added: ""We're going to work on that policy.""But, even for overt critics of Maduro like Rubio, it is difficult to explicitly call for military-backed regime change - something members of Venezuela's opposition have longed called for.Donald Trump campaigned against regime change in 2016, pledging to ""stop racing to topple foreign regimes"" and more recently has condemned engaging in ""forever wars.""",Negative
