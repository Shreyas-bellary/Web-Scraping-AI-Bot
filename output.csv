"US says 'specific steps' agreed to end Syria violence after Israeli strikes hit Damascus Israel says it is ""working to save our Druze brothers"", but Syria accuses it of ""treacherous aggression"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp90l77187zo,"– Israel's military struck the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria on Wednesday, as deadly sectarian fighting in the mostly Druze province of Suweida continued for a fourth day.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his forces were ""working to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the regime's gangs.""The Israeli military began striking Syrian security forces and their weapons on Monday, after they were deployed to the city of Suweida for the first time since Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.""This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law,"" it added.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that the humanitarian situation in Suweida city had rapidly deteriorated.It cited sources as saying there were clashes in several area of the city and that tanks had attacked the national hospital, causing panic among the scores of casualties from the fighting being treated there.The Israeli military said it also struck a ""military target in the area"" of the presidential palace in the capital, as well as armored vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.Israel has not yet commented on the ceasefire bid.",Negative
"Who are the Druze and why is Israel attacking Syria? A fresh wave of deadly sectarian violence has rocked Syria, highlighting the country's fragile security landscape.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70xyv4z74go,"– Israel has been reaching out to the Druze community near its northern border in a bid to forge alliances with Syria's minorities.On Sunday 13 July, the reported abduction of a merchant from the Druze minority sparked days of deadly clashes between Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin fighters in southern Syria.Later on Tuesday 15 July, Israel intervened militarily, saying its forces were seeking to protect the Druze and to eliminate pro-government forces accused of attacking them in Suweida.The violence is the first in the Druze-majority province of Suweida since fighting in April and May between Druze fighters and Syria's new security forces killed dozens of people.The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US was ""very concerned"" about the violence and announced on 16 July: ""We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight.""The deadly unrest, along with the violent Israeli strikes, have re-ignited fears of a security breakdown in Syria, as the country grapples with the fallout from over a decade of civil war, and the recent Islamist-led rebel takeover of Damascus in December 2024. Israel has struck Syria multiple times, with the intention of preventing the new authorities from building its military capacities - viewed as a potential threat to Israeli security.The most recent strikes have primarily acted as a warning and a deterrent against the Syrian army deploying to southern Syria, with Israel seeking to create a demilitarized zone in the area.",Negative
Canada's PM wants to fast-track 'nation building' - but can he? Indigenous communities have launched a legal challenge against a federal law that would fast-track resource development projects.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew0kw29lvro,"– With just a canoe and a tent, the 20-year-old and his family have traveled more than 400 kilometers to protest a provincial law that designated the area a ""special economic zone"" for mining.Now, Prime Minister Mark Carney's 'nation-building' law - his first major piece of legislation - is poised to put even more of a spotlight on the region.The Ring of Fire, a 5,000 square-kilometre area home to significant deposits of chromite, nickel, copper, gold, zinc, and other minerals, has also been flagged as an area ripe for development in partnership with the federal governmentBut while Carney's legislation was considered by many to be an early victory for the new prime minister, environmental groups have raised concerns that the law, and others like it, provide shortcuts to get through existing environmental processes.Chief of Assembly First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak told the BBC that she had requested the upcoming consultations herself.The Assembly of First Nations held a virtual forum with chiefs across Canada last week with Woodhouse Nepinak saying they are ""united,"" and have proposed amendments to the law which they plan to bring up on Thursday.But that might be too late, for some.Chief of Nishnawbe Aski First Nation, Alvin Fiddler, has warned that Carney's law ""will not apply in [their] territories.""The government has hinted at a few items on its wish-list, including a pipeline along the British Columbia coast and a carbon-sandal project in Alberta's oil sands.Carney has said indigenous leadership is central to building a stronger economy, including through the One Canadian Economy Act and initiatives like the Indigenous Loan Guarantee Program.",Positive
Could axing two national holidays save France from its mountain of debt? Prime Minister François Bayrou has angered MPs with a bid to cut two public holidays to rescue the country's finances.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrq8epk7vjo,"– Prime Minister Franois Bayrou has put the cat among the pigeons in promising to cut two of France's national holidays in order to rescue the country's finances.Predictably enough, his proposal on Tuesday to axe the Easter Monday and 8 May holidays triggered howls of protest from the left and the populist right—with his own centrists and the conservative right expressing at best guarded support.In a country with such a strong tradition of worker protest, the sudden removal of two statutory days off was never going to be an easy sell.In a country with such a strong tradition of worker protest, the sudden removal of two statutory days off was never going to be an easy sell.",Positive
"Babies made using three people's DNA are born free of hereditary disease The method was pioneered by UK scientists to overcome devastating, sometimes fatal inherited diseases.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8179z199vo,"– Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say.The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman.The technique has been legal here for a decade but we now have the first proof it is leading to children born free of incurable mitochondrial disease.These conditions are normally passed from mother to child, starving the body of energy. This can cause severe disability and some babies die within days of being born. Couples know they are at risk if previous children, family members or the mother has been affected.Children born through the three-person technique inherit most of their DNA, their genetic blueprint, from their parents, but also get a tiny amount, about 0.1%, from the second woman.The team in Newcastle anticipate there is demand for 20 to 30 babies born through the three-person method each year.It led to four boys and four girls, including one pair of twins, and one ongoing pregnancy.""To see the relief and joy in the faces of the parents of these babies after such a long wait and fear of consequences, it's brilliant to be able to see these babies alive, thriving and developing normally,"" Prof Bobby McFarland, the director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders told the BBC.",Positive
"Trump discussed firing Fed boss but 'highly unlikely' he will The US president admitted he broached sacking Jerome Powell, in what would be an unprecedented move.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4geyrdprwjo,"– President Trump has said it is ""highly unlikely"" he will fire the head of the US central bank, hours after asking lawmakers whether he should sack Jerome Powell. Stock markets and the dollar slipped following reports Trump had broached the idea with Republicans on Tuesday but quickly bounced back after he downplayed the discussions.Dismissing the chair of the Federal Reserve would be a major break with precedent. Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to lower US interest rates in a series of highly critical outbursts, which continued on Wednesday when the president called him a ""knucklehead"" and claimed he was ""doing a lousy job.""The Federal Reserve was established by Congress and has powers to set policy independent of the White House. Powell's second term as Fed chair ends in May next year and he can stay on as a governor of the central bank until 2028.Under federal law, the president can remove Fed governors before the end of their terms ""for cause.""The phrase typically implies serious misconduct.Trump has repeatedly stated his intent to serve out his term as chair, denying that Trump has the power to fire him over a policy disagreement.The White House's increasingly determined aggression against one of the most important independent institutions in the world is adding a new dimension to a fragile global financial system, which is already reeling from Trump's trade wars.",Negative
"Trump's Epstein strategy could pit him against loyal supporters In defending how his administration is handling supposed files on Jeffrey Epstein, he says ""some stupid Republicans"" fell for a hoax.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrlg94wnq9o,"– President Trump is drawing battle lines on the Epstein issue that divides his own side.It also risks cutting through the foundations on which his political strength is built.Trump's success has been powered by two central messages to his supporters—that he's an outsider who fights against a corrupt establishment and that he tells it like it is.The potential flaw in the president's strategy this time became apparent halfway through his post, however, as he turned to blame his own party and his own supporters for falling for what he said was a leftist scheme.Trump, never one to shy away from wild conspiracy theories or those who embrace them, now finds himself arguing that there is no ""credible"" evidence implicating the rich and powerful in the Epstein case and that those believing otherwise are suckers or fools.His shifting comments—that the Epstein files should be released, that there are no files, that any possible files are hoaxes—also make him seem less like a straight-shooter and more like a man with something to hide.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who oversaw those efforts, walked back earlier comments calling for more Epstein files to be disclosed, saying that he was misquoted and that he only wanted the public to see ""credible"" information—the same language Trump has used.An internal Democratic poll obtained by Politico found 58% of respondents believed Trump ""maybe was or definitely was"" involved in a cover-up.Congressional Republicans are backing the president's legislative agenda despite their narrow majorities in key votes this week.",Positive
Sirens and evacuations as Taipei rehearses to counter China invasion threat Taiwan's capital is holding one of its largest ever civil defence exercises.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0w6wrlld0o,"– Taipei is due to come to a standstill as the capital of Taiwan holds one of its largest-ever civil defense exercises against a possible Chinese invasion.Air raid sirens will ring out across the metropolitan area on Thursday, and in some areas residents must seek shelter indoors, while traffic will grind to a halt.The exercise is held in conjunction with Taiwan's largest ever war games—the annual Han Kuang exercises—as the island increasingly ramps up its defenses.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunify"" with the island.This week's Urban Resilience exercise is the latest civil defense drill Taiwan has held this year as it tries to prepare its cities for possible attacks and raise its population's defense awareness.While previous Han Kuang exercises also had civil defense components, this year authorities have combined them in a single Urban Resilience exercise across the island which began on Tuesday and ends on Friday.Each day of the exercise sees air raid sirens ringing out for half an hour in several cities across Taiwan.Residents in designated areas in each city must shelter indoors—or risk incurring a fine—and all shops and restaurants must pause operations.",Negative
Prosecutor in Diddy and Epstein cases fired by justice department,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjxkkpgn1ko,"– The US Department of Justice has fired a veteran federal prosecutor who worked on the cases against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, and hip hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.It is not clear why Maurene Comey was removed from her job at the Southern District of New York, but her exit was confirmed by sources to the BBC's US partner CBS.The justice department has been firing lawyers who worked on cases that angered the president, including the 2021 US Capitol riot and a special prosecutor investigation of Trump.Ms Comey's firing comes after her prosecution team failed in their bid to convict Sean Combs on the most serious charges he faced of racketeering and sex-trafficking.Her father, James Comey, was recently interviewed by the US Secret Service after posting - then deleting - a seashell photo on Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against Trump.Earlier this month it was reported that the justice department had launched an investigation into the former FBI director.",Negative

The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,"" Cassandra Hatton, vice-chairman of science and natural history at Sotheby's, said in a video posted online.It remains unclear where the meteorite will end up as information about the sale will remain private.Additional taxes and fees brought the total price of the rock up to about $5.3m, Sotheby's said.At the Wednesday auction, which featured more than 100 items, a Ceratosaurus skeleton from the late Jurassic period sold for $26m and the skull of a Pachycephalosaurus sold for $1.4m",Positive
