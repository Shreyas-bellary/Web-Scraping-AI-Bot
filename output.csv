"Jeremy Bowen: Israel's allies see evidence of war crimes in Gaza mounting up The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October, and almost two years on, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp863mln0pmo,"– Two years ago, Hamas was putting the finishing touches to its plan to attack Israel. In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed that the Palestinians were a problem to be managed. In Washington, then-President Joe Biden and his administration believed they were close to hatching a deal between the Saudis and Israelis.It was all a series of illusions. Netanyahu has refused to establish an enquiry to look into the mistakes he made alongside his army and security chiefs that gave Hamas its opportunity to attack with such deadly effect on 7 October 2023.The century-long conflict between Jews and Arabs for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean was unresolved, festering, and about to explode into a war that looks to be as consequential as its other landmarks, in 1948 and 1967.The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October when Hamas attacked, and almost two years into the war, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point. Allies who rallied around after the 7 October Hamas attacks have lost patience with Israel's conduct in Gaza.Even Israel's most important ally, Donald Trump, is reported to be losing patience with Netanyahu after being taken by surprise when the Israeli leader ordered the bombing of Damascus—attacking Syria's new regime, which Trump has recognized and encouraged.Other western allies of Israel ran out of patience months ago.Another joint statement, condemning Israel's actions, was signed on 21 July by foreign ministers from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.It was not enough for Labour MPs, who want strong words to be backed by strong actions.",Negative

Trump's ex-lawyer replaced as federal prosecutor by judges,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9vm03yye4o,"– A group of US judges has voted to replace President Trump's selection for New Jersey's top federal prosecutor amid opposition from Democrats in the state. Alina Habba had served as Trump's personal attorney, defending him in several legal cases, before she was chosen for the role in March. Trump officially nominated her to take the post, but Democrats in the Senate blocked her path to confirmation.It is rare for judges to reject an interim prosecutor from continuing in the role, according to experts.The judges instead selected her deputy, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to take over the role.Habba has clashed with Democrats since taking office in March.It is uncommon for judges to oppose an interim prosecutor from staying on, absent confirmation from the US Senate.Both of New Jersey's senators - who are each Democrats - have opposed her nomination to be the US attorney for the state, arguing that she has pursued ""frivolous and politically motivated"" prosecutions and ""did not meet the standard"" for the office.It is unusual for judges to choose someone other than the interim US attorney, although choosing the first assistant ""is generally a sensible choice,"" said University Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.Habba has clashed with Democrats since taking office in March.She has filed assault charges against a Democratic congressman, and opened investigations into the state's Democratic governor and attorney general.",Negative
