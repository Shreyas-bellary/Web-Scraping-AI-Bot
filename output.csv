Many are finding only ruins, with once cherished items that were left behind now buried beneath the rubble. The BBC has spoken to people about the things—from the sentimental to the seemingly mundane—they have held close throughout the war, and the risks they have taken to not lose them. I was displaced several times through the war, including being on the street for days with no shelter until some good guys provided us with a tent. I have tortoises and a bird called Bico—a rose-ringed parakeet. I called him Luca because I got him by luck—I found him on the street, covered in insects. In the last displacement, when the tanks reached us, I went to another family's home but the people got annoyed with my pets so I went back to my mum's apartment even though it was under evacuation orders and there were tanks. The cage for the birds is worn out and broken now from moving it from one place to another. It's not suitable for them to be in, but there is no replacement and even if I could find one it would be very expensive. I've also struggled to find food for the animals. But I won't let any harm come to them—my birds, my tortoises and my cat.",Negative
