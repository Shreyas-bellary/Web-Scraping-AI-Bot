US court rules many of Trump's global tariffs are illegal The tariffs can remain in place until mid-October to allow the Trump administration time to request the Supreme Court take up the case.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgj7jxkq58o,"– A US appeals court has ruled that most tariffs issued by US President Donald Trump are illegal, setting up a potential legal showdown that could upend his foreign policy agenda.The ruling affects Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs, imposed on most countries around the world, as well as other tariffs slapped on China, Mexico, and Canada.In a 7-4 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Trump's argument that the tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act, calling them ""invalid as contrary to law.""The ruling will not take effect until 14 October to give the administration time to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case. Trump criticized the court and its ruling on Truth Social, saying: ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.""""Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,"" he wrote.Trump had justified the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president the power to act against ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats.The White House argued that invalidating the tariffs would lead to a 1929-style financial collapse, a stock market crash which led to the Great Depression.""The President believes that our country would not be able to pay back the trillions of dollars that other countries have already committed to pay, which could lead to financial ruin.""The ruling also raises questions about deals some nations agreed with the US for reduced tariffs rates.",Positive
US blocks Palestinian leader from attending UN meeting in New York The decision comes as France leads international efforts to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN meeting next month.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdym32z9v7o,"– Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been blocked from attending the UN General Assembly session in New York next month after he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked, the US State Department has confirmed. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking ""the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state."" The decision, which has been welcomed by Israel, is unusual as the US is expected to facilitate travel for officials of all countries wishing to visit the UN headquarters.Abbas' office said it was astonished by the visa decision, which ""stands in clear contradiction to international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement, particularly since the State of Palestine is an observer member of the United Nations.""It is important that all member states, permanent observers, be able to be represented, especially I think in this case with the, as we know, the upcoming two-state solution meeting that France and Saudi Arabia will host at the beginning of the GA,"" Mr Dujarric said.Apart from France, the UK, Canada, and Australia have also announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the GA meeting next month.The state of Palestine is currently recognized by 147 of the UN's 193 member states.But with no recognized borders, Israeli settlers controlling large parts of the West Bank - illegal under international law - and calls to do the same in Gaza, any recognition of a Palestinian state would not change much on the ground.",Positive

"Trump's rebuke, Xi's handshake, Putin's oil: India's foreign policy test India’s foreign policy sits uneasily in the Trump-led order, caught between Russia and strained US relations.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80d2nvzg72o,"– Prime Minister Narendra Modi's planned meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing on Sunday looks less like triumphal diplomacy and more like pragmatic rapprochement.Yet, Delhi's foreign policy is at an uneasy crossroads.India sits in two camps at once: a pillar of Washington's Indo-Pacific Quad with Japan, the US and Australia, and a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the China and Russia-led bloc that often runs counter to US interests.China's envoy in Delhi Xu Feihong recently denounced Washington's steep tariffs on Indian goods, calling the US a ""bully.""Analysts say this balancing act is no accident.India prizes strategic autonomy and argues that engaging with competing camps gives it leverage rather than exposure.""Hedging is a bad choice.But the alternative of aligning with anyone is worse.India's best choice is the bad choice, which is hedging,"" Jitendra Nath Misra, a former Indian ambassador and currently a professor at OP Jindal Global University, told the BBC.""India may not be fully confident of holding its own by aligning with a great power.As Sumit Ganguly of Stanford University's Hoover Institution points out, US-China rivalry remains'structurally irreconcilable', while Russia has been reduced to Beijing's 'junior partner.'",Positive

Canadian luxury retailer SSENSE to file for bankruptcy protection,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqvg293gvpo,"– Canadian luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has said it plans to file for bankruptcy protection, partly citing pressure from US tariffs including on US-bound low value parcels, which just came into effect.In an email to staff from CEO Rami Atallah, the Montreal-based firm said it was ""surprised"" by the elimination of the de minimis exemption for shipments to the US.The de minimis exemption allowed for duty-free shipping to the US on packages worth $800 (C$1,100; £592) or less, and was widely used by e-commerce firms and global retailers to ship small packages to the US.President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending the exemption last month.This, along with the suspension of the de minimis exemption and the lenders' move to sell the company without its consent, has ""created an immediate liquidity crisis no short-term fix could solve"", he said. SSENSE was founded by Mr Atallah and his brothers in 2003 and has become a popular online fashion retailer, employing around 1,200 people globally.The Canadian retailer is one of many small- and medium-sized businesses that have expressed concerns about Trump's cut of the long-standing de minimis exemption on US-bound shipments.Tapestry - the parent company of US fashion brand Coach, which sells leather bags from roughly $200 to $1,000 - told analysts this month that it expects to take $160m hit to its profits due to changing tariff policies, with about a third of that attributed to the elimination of the de minimis rule.Some, like Canadian clothing retailer Province of Canada, have paused shipments to the US ""until further notice"" due to the additional tariffs.",Positive
