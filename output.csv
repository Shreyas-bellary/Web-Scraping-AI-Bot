"Putin vows no more wars if West treats Russia with respect Russia's leader said during a TV marathon that claims that an attack on Europe was planned were ""nonsense"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp89p082y2xo,"– Russian President Vladimir Putin has said there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect—and dismissed claims that Moscow is planning to attack European countries as ""nonsense.""In a televised event lasting almost four and a half hours, he was asked by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg whether there would be new ""special military operations""—Putin's term for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.""There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,"" he asserted.Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready ""right now"" if Europeans wanted to.Putin again claimed to be ""ready and willing"" to end the war in Ukraine ""peacefully"" but offered little sign of compromise.He repeated his insistence on principles he had outlined in a June 2024 speech, when he demanded that Ukrainian forces leave four regions Russia partially occupies and that Kyiv gives up its efforts to join NATO.Most of the questions from Russian media or from the public made little attempt to challenge Putin, but two were allowed from Western correspondents, Keir Simmons of US network NBC and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.When Simmons asked if Putin would feel responsible for the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians if he rejected the Trump peace plan, Putin praised the US president's ""sincere"" efforts to end the war, but said it was the West not Russia that was blocking a deal.""The ball is in the hands of our Western opponents,"" he said, ""primarily the leaders of the Kyiv regime, and in this case, first and foremost, their European sponsors.""",Neutral
Watch: President Trump's name added to facade of Kennedy Center Crews work on the facade of the Kennedy Center after the board voted to add Trump's name to the performing arts venue.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cdxwpk05p51o,"– President Trump's name is on the Kennedy Center's facade after its board voted to add President Trump's name to the performing arts venue. Shortly after taking office, President Trump fired all the center's board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. The change will certainly meet controversy, particularly in Washington DC where the center has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for President John F Kennedy. The beloved New York tradition launched with 34 giant balloons and 28 dazzling floats. The US vice-president questioned the traditional holiday meal while meeting with troops at Fort Campbell in Tennessee.",Positive

Timothée Chalamet teams up with EsDeeKid to quash alter-ego rumours Speculation has run riot that the US actor had been leading a double life as the masked rapper.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79x4yqx0ngo,"– Timothée Chalamet has finally quashed rumors that he is cult anonymous rapper EsDeeKid - by performing alongside him in a new video.Speculation has run riot that the Oscar-nominated US actor has been leading a double life as the masked rapper, who only ever reveals his eyes.Some followers spotted an apparent resemblance with Chalamet's eyes, and when the BBC questioned the star about the connection earlier this week, he responded: ""No comment... You'll see, all in due time.""Now, the actor - who adopted the hip-hop moniker Lil Timmy Tim in high school - has scotched the conspiracies by posting a video of himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the musician's top 40 hit 4Raws.In the music video, Chalamet appeared to refer to the rumors by starting with only his eyes on show, like the drill artist, before pulling down the bandana from his face and dropping the bars: ""It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million.""He then referenced his partner Kylie Jenner with the line: ""Girl got $1 billion.""The clip was filmed at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, and was reposted by EsDeeKid.The speculation has been seized upon by fans in recent weeks, and both sides stayed silent as EsDeeKid reached the UK top 10 and Chalamet promoted his new film.He even gave the title, Marty Supreme, several shout-outs in the new collaboration, building on an already savvy marketing campaign for the film.But it was always far-fetched that the two people could be one and the same, and that Chalamet could have pulled off with EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.Their collaboration quickly went viral, with British rapper Central Cee replying ""Naaa"" with crying and laughing and laughing emojis.",Positive
