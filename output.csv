"Kyiv can win all of Ukraine back from Russia, Trump says The US president says Ukraine can win back land with support from Nato and Europe, marking a major shift in his position.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07vm35rryeo,"– US President Donald Trump has said Kyiv can ""win all of Ukraine back in its original form"", marking a major shift in his position on the war with Russia.In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said Ukraine could get back ""the original borders from where this war started"" with the support of Europe and NATO, due to pressures on Russia's economy.Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to end the war, but has previously warned that process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory, an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected. Asked if the US would support its NATO allies if they shot down Russian aircraft, Trump said it ""depends on the circumstance"" and praised the military alliance for increasing defense spending.""Nato has stepped up,"" he said, referring to an agreement by leaders to ramp up defense spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035.Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose tougher measures on Russia, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions, saying they were ""funding a war against themselves."" Tuesday's Truth Social post represents an about-face after Trump spent most of the year insisting that Ukraine's situation was dire.Before talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, Trump told Zelensky during their fiery Oval Office exchange that he did ""not have the cards right now"" to prevail against a larger, more populous nation in a war of attrition.",Negative
"Six years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silent The US leader's address was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, writes James Landale.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c179p4wvz29o,"– Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations was one of the clearest expositions of the way he sees the world, his ideology in its rawest form. To his supporters, it will be seen as Trumpism unplugged; to his critics, Trumpism unhinged.Over almost an hour, he took aim at his opponents and their ideas, picking them off one by one as he toured the world. He began at home, praising the United States and himself. He said the US was living through a golden age and repeated his much-disputed claim that he had personally ended seven wars, something he argued merited a Nobel Peace Prize.But then the president laid into his hosts. Trump saved perhaps his biggest criticism for his European allies, attacking the continent for investing in renewable energy, and opening its borders to migration.He also attacked the UN for the aid it gave to asylum seekers hoping to enter the US, saying ""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.""On one level, he has a point. But on another level Trump can be seen himself a cause and symptom of the UN's lack of effectiveness; for he believes global crises are best resolved by powerful men like him getting together and hammering out a deal, not using multilateral bodies like the UN to work out collective solutions.",Positive

"Man found guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump in Florida Ryan Routh, 59, was spotted hiding in bushes with a rifle at the president's Florida golf club last year.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdv0118npo,"– A jury found Ryan Routh, 59, guilty of all charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and a range of firearm offenses.The incident happened on 15 September 2024 as Trump, then a presidential candidate, was playing golf on a course he owns in West Palm Beach, about 15 minutes from his Mar-a-Lago residence.A US Secret Service agent spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired on the man holding it—later identified as Routh—who then fled the scene. Routh attempted to harm himself after the verdict was read out, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.The court heard that during the assassination attempt, Routh hid in bushes behind a perimeter fence at the Trump International Golf Club.He is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point, but agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said they found a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and extended magazine where he was hiding.Routh appeared stoic throughout his remarks.The court also heard that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was expected to appear, and a note for a friend stating ""this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.""Routh ended his remarks after nearly an hour, arguing that there had been no intent to kill because he had not pulled the trigger.The incident in Florida was the second high-profile attempt on Trump's life that year, after a gunman opened fire during a political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July 2024.",Negative
"The Gen Z revolution in Asia shows the power of the young - and their limits Anti-corruption demonstrations, powered by social media, have toppled a government - but will they lead to lasting change?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4ljv39em7o,"– It was the wedding of the daughter of a Nepalese politician that first angered Aditya.The 23-year-old activist was scrolling through his social media feed in May, when he read complaints about how the high-profile marriage ceremony sparked huge traffic jams in the city of Bhaktapur.What riled him most were claims that a major road was blocked for hours for VIP guests, who reportedly included the Nepalese prime minister.On 8 September, determined to fight what he saw as corruption, Aditya and his friends joined thousands of young protesters on the streets of the capital Kathmandu.As the protests gathered pace, there were clashes between demonstrators and police, leaving some protesters dead.The following day, crowds stormed parliament and burned down government offices.The prime minister KP Sharma Oli resigned.This was one part of a fervour for change that has swept across Asia in recent months.They all have one thing in common: they are driven by Generation Z, many of whom are furious at what they see as endemic corruption in their countries.Governments in the region say there is a risk of the protests spiralling into unacceptable violence.But Aditya, like many demonstrators, believes it is the start of an era of newfound protester power.He was inspired by the protests in Indonesia, as well as last year's student-led revolution in Bangladesh and the Aragalaya protest movement that toppled Sri Lanka's president in 2022, and he argues that all stand for the same thing: the ""wellbeing and development of our nations.""Much of the anger has focused on so-called 'nepo kids' - young people perceived as benefitting from the fame.To many demonstrators, these 'nepo kids' symbolise deeper corruption.'",Negative
