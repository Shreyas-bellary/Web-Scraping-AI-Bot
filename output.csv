"The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbook - but now finds his power crumbling Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban finds his power under threat, but not in the way one might expect.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd1j1x2l1lo,"– Hungarians have a popular saying: ""Visszanyal a fagyi."" Translation: ""The ice-cream licks back."" In other words, watch out, because what you enjoy devouring, might enjoy devouring you.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has assiduously attacked a liberal world view for at least two decades, transforming the country into what he has variously called an ""illiberal democracy"" and nation of ""Christian liberty.""Ahead of the next Hungarian election in April 2026, the LGBTQ community appear to be among Orban's targets—his Fidesz party rubber stamped a new law that sought to ban Pride from going ahead.But watching huge crowds march through Budapest to celebrate gay pride, free speech and the right to assemble—all in defiance of the ban—many wonder: could the liberal worldview bite back?""",Positive
