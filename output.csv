"Washington talks could prove more vital for Ukraine's future than Trump-Putin summit The Washington meeting could prove to be crucial to the future of Ukraine, and all of Europe's security.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglxlx5vldo,"– Monday's meeting in the White House could prove even more crucial to the future of Ukraine—and for all of Europe's security—than last Friday's US-Russia summit in Alaska.""The presence of Sir Keir Starmer, President Macron, Chancellor Merz and other leaders alongside President Zelensky in Washington is about more than making sure he does not get ambushed in the Oval Office again, in the way he did on 28 February.""But even if peace does break out on the battlefield we are still in dangerous territory.For a peace deal in Ukraine to have any chance of working, something has to give.European leaders have said frequently that international borders cannot be changed by force and President Zelensky has said time and time again he will not give up land and besides, Ukraine's constitution forbids it.But Putin wants the Donbas, which his forces already control around 85% of Crimea, and he has absolutely no intention of ever handing back.Yet as the former Estonian PM and now Europe's top diplomat Kaja Kallas once said to me: victory for Ukraine in this war does not have to be exclusively about reconquering occupied land.'",Negative
