"Tit-for-tat tariffs, a shaky truce and turmoil: How we got to the Trump-Xi meeting US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet to discuss a trade deal.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c986j98qmj1o,"– President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet on Thursday, with their countries appearing closer than ever to a trade deal. Officials on both sides said earlier this week that they had reached a consensus ""to address their respective concerns."" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went as far as to say that he did not expect the 100% levy Trump had threatened to impose on Chinese goods to take effect.It took 10 months—of tariffs, a shaky truce, uncertainty for manufacturers and businesses world over—for Trump and Xi to meet.So, how did we get here? Trump kicked off his trade war with China well before ""Liberation Day"" in April—the date on which he unveiled levies on most countries, hitting both allies and foes. Observers are expecting Trump and Xi to finalize the deal on the sale of TikTok's US operations when they come face to face.The meeting is expected to happen at the Gimhae International Airport in the South Korean city of Busan—soon after Xi arrives in the country for the Apec summit, and just before Trump flies out.",Negative
"Latest US boat strike kills four in the Pacific, Hegseth says The suspected drug traffickers were killed in an escalating conflict taking place at sea.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3xq9wx5zyo,"– A US attack on a boat suspected of transporting illegal drugs has left four men dead in the eastern Pacific Ocean, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced on X on Wednesday.""Earlier today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on yet another narco-trafficking vessel,"" Hegseth posted.On Monday, US strikes on suspected drug-trafficking ships in the Pacific killed 14 people, according to Hegseth. The latest strikes, which have come at the direction of the president, mark an escalation in what the White House has cast as a campaign to stop seaborne narcotics from entering the US via both the Pacific and Caribbean. Hegseth's post included a video showing a vessel catching fire after being struck by US munitions.""The Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans,"" he wrote.He added that the attack took place in international waters, and that no US personnel were harmed.At least 60 people have been killed in the strikes over the past two months, which has led to increasing tensions between the US and the governments of both Colombia and Venezuela.The US has been steadily building up a force of warships, fighter jets, Marines, spy planes, bombers, and drones in the Caribbean, deploying the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford.Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organization, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power.",Negative

Dr Tedros said prior to the Saudi Hospital attack, the WHO had verified 185 attacks on health care facilities since the start of the war, resulting in 1,204 deaths.""All attacks on health care must stop immediately and unconditionally.Ceasefire!"" he said.",Negative

Fed cuts US interest rates again despite 'flying blind' Central bank votes to lower cost of borrowing even as US government shutdown limits data for decision,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0p7g7560o,"– The Fed last month cut interest rates for the first time since last December. Economists expected the move to jump-start further reductions, but the data drought means the trajectory for future cuts looks murky. The US Federal Reserve pushed forward with an interest rate cut as inflation fears continue to take a backseat to concerns about a stalling labor market.It came despite the US government shutdown, nearing its one-month mark, which delayed official data and left central bankers ""flying blind"" about the job market, economists said.The US central bank said on Wednesday it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 3.75% to 4%.The Fed last month cut interest rates for the first time since last December. Fed chair Jerome Powell called the labor market ""less dynamic and somewhat softer"" than earlier this year, pointing in part to lower immigration. Still, he said weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating.The ongoing government shutdown has stalled the release of the official monthly jobs report for September, limiting central bankers' insight into how the labor market has fared since their last meeting.Stephen Miran, who is on leave from his post leading US President Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, voted for a larger 0.5 percentage point cut. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to hold rates steady.",Negative
How China really spies on the UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4xpyrkdqo,"– It is a question that successive governments have struggled with: what kind of threat does China really pose to the UK?Trying to answer it may have contributed to the high-profile collapse of the case in which two British men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, were accused of spying for China and charged under the Official Secrets Act.Both deny wrongdoing—but when charges were dropped last month, it sparked political outcry.Prosecutors and officials have since offered conflicting accounts about whether a failure or unwillingness to label China as an active threat to national security led to the withdrawal of the charges.But this all raises the question of what exactly Chinese espionage looks like in the modern world.On one level, China spies within the traditional framework of the old ways of human espionage associated with the Cold War, with spies working under the cover of being diplomats, and recruiting people to pass secrets.Another area that worries UK security officials is China's predilection for spying on dissidents, known as transnational repression, something that has been a primary target for Chinese intelligence for years with a focus on groups like Tibetan campaigners.The arrival in the UK of many young pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong, following Beijing's clampdown, has heightened the concerns. MI5 has also warned that Beijing was cultivating local politicians in the early stages of their career with the hope of seeding them into more senior positions—a sign of a long-term, patient strategy to build influence.",Negative
"Two suspects partially admit involvement in Louvre heist, prosecutor says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77z607g14go,"– Two men arrested in connection with the Louvre theft two weeks ago have ""partially recognized"" their involvement in the brazen heist, according to officials.The pair in custody are suspected of being the two who used power tools to enter the museum's Apollon gallery and steal some of the French crown jewels. Items worth 88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the jewels had not been recovered yet, and the gang involved could be bigger than the four people caught on CCTV.The two men, both in their thirties, have criminal records and were identified by DNA found during investigations, Beccuau said.One of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but Beccuau said the other man had not been planning to leave France, despite earlier media reports.There was no evidence currently to suggest the theft was an inside job confirming no accomplices worked at the museum, she added.But Beccuau said she was not ruling out the possibility that this involved more than the four suspects caught on CCTV, including the people expecting to receive the stolen jewels.""I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation"", she said.A crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was dropped by the thieves as they fled.",Negative
