Anger in Paris after police kill teen in traffic stop Unrest follows the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old who failed to obey traffic police.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66038227,"– Paris police chief Laurent Nuez told French television station BFMTV that the policeman's actions ""raises questions"", though he suggested the officer may have felt threatened. The 17-year-old's family lawyer Yassine Bouzrou insisted that was an illegitimate defense, telling the same channel the video ""clearly showed a policeman killing a young man in cold blood."" Another lawyer representing the victim's family, Jennifer Cambla, told local media that nothing could justify what had happened, and described the death as an ""execution."" The shooting triggered a series of protests on Tuesday night in Nanterre, the area just west of Paris where the teenager was killed. Police initially suggested the teen drove his car towards them with the intention of hurting them. But footage posted online, verified by AFP news agency, tells a different story. It shows two officers trying to stop the vehicle. One points his weapon at the driver through the window and appears to fire at point-blank range as he tries to drive off. The agency also reports that a person in the video can be heard saying ""you're going to be shot in the head"" - but it is unclear who says it. Paris police chief Laurent Nuez told French television station BFMTV that the policeman's actions ""raises questions"", though he suggested the officer may have felt threatened.

China crackdown pushes LGBT groups into the shadows It comes as the largest LGBT celebration in the country has been suspended since 2021.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65806846,"– While celebrations were held around the world for Pride month, there were no major LGBT events in China. The country's largest Pride event has been suspended since 2021. The organizer, a group named ShanghaiPride, did not give a reason for the move, saying at the time it was ""cancelling all upcoming activities and taking a break from scheduling any future events."" People taking part in political protests in China often face punishment, so instead of holding parades, ShanghaiPride had organized dance parties, community runs and film screenings in the city. Now, only a few low-profile events are available for the LGBT community such as ""voguing balls"", where dancers execute moves inspired by model poses. ""With the closure of the Beijing LGBT Center, the last large LGBT organization in China has decided to take a break,"" Raymond Phang, the co-founder of ShanghaiPride, told the BBC. Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997 and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. But space for LGBT advocacy has shrunk in recent years, along with a clamping down of civil rights movements and online dissent.",Negative
South Koreans become a year younger under new law Seoul scraps a centuries-old age-counting system in favour of international standards.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66028606,"– South Koreans have become a year or two younger as a new law aligns the nation's two traditional age-counting methods with international standards. The law scraps one traditional system that deemed South Koreans one year old at birth, counting time in the womb. Another counted everyone as aging by a year every first day of January instead of on their birthdays. The switch to age-counting based on birth date took effect on Wednesday. President Yoon Suk-yeol pushed strongly for the change when he ran for office last year. Previously, the most widely used calculation method in Korea was the centuries-old ""Korean age"" system, in which a person turns one at birth and gains a year on 1 January. This means a baby born on 31 December will be two years old the next day. A separate ""counting age"" system that was also traditionally used in the country, considers a person zero at birth and adds a year on 1 January. This means that, for example, as of 28 June 2023, a person born on 29 June 2003 is 19 under the international system, 20 under the ""counting age"" system and 21 under the ""Korean age"" system.",Positive
When Miss World in India threatened 'cultural apocalypse' The competition is being held in India for the first time since 1996 - when it sparked uproar.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65903713,"– The Miss World pageant was organized in India by a company owned by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. According to reports, the firm hired more than 2,000 technicians, 500 dancers, and even 16 elephants for the event. But weeks before the show, violent protests broke out in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) city, the venue. Members of a women's organization threatened mass suicide, saying that competitions like Miss World would ""increase promiscuity and prostitution."" The contestants were sheltered from the controversy as much as possible—they were cooped up inside a luxurious five-star hotel for weeks with little outside contact. But almost three decades after the 1996 competition was also due to fears that ""middle class, upper-caste women""—who usually participated in these events—would be seen wearing swimsuits in public. In 2013, the final of Miss World was shifted from Indonesia's capital Jakarta to tourist haven Bali after weeks of protests from conservative Islamic groups—there too, the bikini round was scrapped, with contestants wearing ""modest, traditional Balinese sarongs.""",Negative
"Belarus leader welcomes Wagner boss into exile Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a Russian mutiny, arrives in Belarus and his men are offered a military base.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66029636,"– The leader of Russia's 24-hour mutiny, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has arrived in Belarus, three days after his Wagner mercenary group's mutiny came to an end 125 miles south of Moscow.Mr Lukashenko said Wagner mercenaries had been offered an abandoned military base if they wanted to join their leader: ""There is a fence, everything is available, erect your tents."" Under the deal that brought an end to the mutiny, Mr Prigozhin has been promised security and the Russian criminal case against Wagner has been dropped.Whatever the truth of how 24 hours of mayhem did come to an end, one elaborate version was presented on Tuesday by Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is widely thought to have rigged 2020 elections to maintain power.Mr Prigozhin also accused the Russian military of a missile strike on his men on Friday, killing 30 people.But then President Putin himself told an array of Russian security forces assembled in a Kremlin square that they had defended their motherland, ""de facto stopping a civil war in its tracks.""Mr Prigozhin's private army had been fully funded by the state, with $1bn spent on salaries and bonuses in 12 months.The mutineers' ease in seizing control of the city of Rostov-on-Don and then driving so far north with little opposition has exposed major weaknesses in the Kremlin's control of security in Russia after 23 years of Putin rule.",Negative
Cyclone survivors go hungry as junta blocks aid,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-65995101,"– Millions who survived one of Myanmar's strongest cyclones are now struggling to rebuild their lives after the government cut off access to affected areas, including for aid groups.The move has ""turned an extreme weather event into a man-made catastrophe,"" Human Rights Watch has said.Aid kept trickling in until 8 June, when Myanmar's army rulers, or junta as they are known, banned transportation for aid groups operating in the area, making it impossible for them to deliver aid.But a Rakhine government spokesman told local media that they wanted to manage the distribution of aid, which he claimed had not been administered fairly.This is a reference to the Muslim Rohingya community, the majority of whom live in Rakhine.The UN estimates that more than half a million of them still live in northern Rakhine, although many have fled the country because of persecution.Aid groups have not responded to the allegation, but told the BBC that the Rohingya's ethnicity could have played a role in the decision.It is certainly our experience that the Myanmar military puts significant barriers... [on our efforts] to help Rohingya and have actively diminished the human rights of the communities,"" said Claire Gibbons from Partners Relief & Development, a non-profit group that works in Myanmar.",Positive

Van life is far from glamorous on LA's streets,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66023691,"– It's one of many makeshift trailer parks in Los Angeles where a growing number of people live rough in vans and motorhomes with no access to running water or electricity. But a growing number pay rent— anywhere from $400-$1,000 (£314-£784) a month—to ""van lords"" who advertise motorhomes online. Many of the vans are inoperable and some don't even have motors. But the doors lock and they offer cheap shelter in neighborhoods where $2,000 a month often isn't enough for a studio apartment. The city is now considering a crackdown on van lords amid growing complaints about sewage, environmental damage, and a series of fires from the trailer parks. Los Angeles City Councilwoman Traci Park wants to crack down on the van lords, who are not required to meet the same standards and regular landlords, calling them ""unscrupulous.""",Negative
NYC's plan to slice pizza emissions causes backlash,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66027038,"– A proposal to slice emissions from coal and wood-burning pizza ovens in New York City by 75% has left a bad taste in the mouths of some locals. A rule change proposed on Friday would require pizzerias to evaluate whether they can install emissions control devices for their kitchens stoves. On Monday, a man tossed slices of pizza at New York City Hall in protest. ""Give us pizza or give us death,"" shouted conservative activist Scott LoBaido, in a reference to an anti-British Revolutionary War slogan. Pizzeria owners told New York news outlets that they expect to spend tens of thousands of dollars to install the emissions-trapping machines. But he added that the cost will need to be passed on to customers, saying: ""You know how many pizzas I have to sell to pay for that $20,000 oven?"" Paul Giannone, owner of Paulie Gee's in Brooklyn, told the New York Post that he has already spent $20,000 (£15,600) preparing for the new rule to take effect. The new rule proposed by the city's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will apply to coal and wood-fired ovens installed before 2016. Officials say it will affect less than 100 of the city's countless pizza joints.",Negative
Julian Sands: Free-spirited actor whose career started with a kiss,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-64346313,"– Actor Julian Sands, whose death has been confirmed five months after he went missing, was a magnetic presence on screen—whether playing romantic heroes in films like 1985's A Room With a View, like villains in TV's 24, or offbeat roles in cult releases. Sands earned a place in millions of hearts as the dashing George Emerson in A Room With a View. At one point in the Merchant Ivory epic, George perched precariously among the branches of an olive tree on an Italian hillside, listing life's most important things at the top of his voice: ""Beauty! Liberty! Joy! Love!"" His father, played by Denholm Elliott, explained matter-of-factly that George was simply ""declaring the 'eternal yes'."" Lucy Honeychurch, played by an 18-year-old Helena Bonham Carter, staggered into a field to trace the commotion. He strode through the tall barley and gathered her in a passionate embrace without saying a word. It was the scene that turned Sands into an idol for a generation, and helped make the Oscar-winning film a timeless romance. A Room With a View was one of Sands' first films, following parts in The Killing Fields and Oxford Blues. He then took projects that piqued his interest alongside those that paid his rent, portraying romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in director Ken Russell's Gothic, and appearing in spider-filled thriller Arachnophobia and supernatural horror Warlock.",Positive
The India show on colliding worlds of crime and media,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65887676,"– The sensational murder of India's best known crime reporter in June 2011 and the subsequent arrest of a female crime journalist on allegations of being involved in the murder had stunned the country. Jyotirmoy Dey, popularly known as J Dey, was shot dead in Mumbai by men on motorcycles on orders from one of India's most notorious gangsters, Chhota Rajan—he was convicted in 2018 and is serving a life sentence for the killing. But somehow, Jigna Vora, a newspaper journalist, got caught up in the storm and was charged— falsely—for involvement in the murder. Ms Vora was acquitted in 2018 since the police failed to produce any evidence against her. A single parent to a 10-year-old boy, Ms Vora was acquitted in 2018 since the police failed to produce any evidence against her. Based on Ms Vora's 2019 memoir - Behind The Bars In Byculla: My Days in Prison - Scoop is a gripping tale of a real-life crime, Mumbai's mafia and the role of the police and the press.",Negative

BBC uncovers drugs trade link to top Syrian officials,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66002450,"– In March, Britain, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on a list of people - including two cousins of President Assad - suspected of involvement in the Captagon trade. But the BBC's investigation, deep inside Syria's narco-state, has found evidence indicating the involvement of other senior Syrian officials in addition to those already included in that list. Captagon is a highly addictive amphetamine-like drug that has plagued the Middle East in recent years. Over the past year, the BBC has filmed with the Jordanian and Lebanese armies, observing their campaigns to stop Captagon being smuggled across the borders into their countries from Syria. The BBC has found bags of what appeared to be Captagon pills prepared for distribution and a machine which could be used to press pills, as well as Mr Falhout's Syrian military ID card and an unlocked mobile phone. Gaining exclusive access to the phone, the BBC found a series of messages between Mr Falhout and a Lebanese contact he called ""Abu Hamza"", in which they discussed the purchase of the pill-pressing machine. The BBC has found further evidence of Assad family involvement in the business.",Positive
Trump heard on tape discussing secret documents,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66027036,"– An audio recording in which Donald Trump appears to acknowledge keeping a classified document after leaving the White House has been obtained by US media. In the recording, the former president is heard riffling through papers and saying: ""This is highly confidential."" It was first obtained by CNN, but the BBC's US partner CBS also has the clip. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of mishandling sensitive documents. Prosecutors allege the former president showed classified documents to people without security clearance on two occasions, including a writer and two members of staff. It is not clear from the indictment, however, if the documents referenced in the recording were ever recovered by investigators.",Negative
Trafficked for a kidney and now forced into hiding,https://www.bbc.com/news/65960515,"– Daniel was about to get the fright of his life. He was sitting in a consulting room at the Royal Free hospital in London, speaking to doctors with his limited English. The 21-year-old street trader from Lagos, Nigeria, had come to the UK days earlier for what he had been told was a ""life-changing opportunity."" He thought he was going to get a better job. But now doctors were talking to him about the risks of the operation and the need for lifelong medical care. It was at that moment, Daniel told investigators, that he realized there was no job opportunity and he had been brought to the UK to give a kidney to a stranger. Daniel was taken to several meetings with medical consultants at the private patients' unit at London's Royal Free Hospital. His testimony led detectives to Sonia's father, one of Nigeria's most powerful politicians. The BBC has learned that his ground-breaking case alerted UK authorities to other instances of organ trafficking. Daniel's case reveals the tactics used by traffickers to lure people to the UK under false pretences. Sonia, who was 25 at the time, has a serious form of kidney disease. She needs a transplant and is on dialysis for five hours a day, three or four times a week. The Royal Free Hospital told us it had followed the official guidance in Daniel's case and ""as such a decision was taken not to proceed."" Ekweremadu was a senior senator and a multi-millionaire, who was paying for his family to be schooled in the UK. At his trial earlier this year, Ekweremadu said he had been misled and never intended to exploit Daniel.",Positive
The problem with 'fun' company retreats,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230623-what-happens-when-fun-corporate-retreats-cross-a-line,"– ""A lot of these people may interact online on a day-to-day basis, but they're only seeing an avatar or a name on screen. This is a chance to bring people together in person, and create a chance to connect at least once per year."" So says Sean Hoff, managing partner at Canada-based firm Moniker, which has organized corporate retreats for companies including Uber, Shopify, and PayPal, in the Guardian. But the worst part was a brainstorming session where I was paired with a really senior member of the team and had to throw out ideas for how to grow the business.""I was worried I'd end up saying the completely wrong thing, and it would come back to haunt me further down the line."" Such corporate getaways are generally well-intentioned. But that aim isn't always the reality for employees required to attend.

Indonesia's futuristic take on travel,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230627-indonesias-futuristic-take-on-travel,"– It had taken the blacksmith-turned-priest 70 hours to create the bell, which was molded with black volcanic soil and formed from gold, silver, copper, zinc and iron. However, his legacy is not only protected by his craftsmanship, but the fact he is now one of 11 artisans from Indonesia who are helping to protect the country's past and future by placing their work on Web3. The artisans have joined with Quantum Temple, a Web3 platform designed to preserve cultural heritage, and Indonesia's Ministry of Tourism to create Paths to Alang, a collection of NFTs, one-of-a-kind digital assets that are sold through Web3.

Is Hollywood too coy for sex comedies?,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230627-no-hard-feelings-jennifer-lawrence-in-hollywoods-coyest-sex-comedy,"– In a widely reported comment about her punningly-titled No Hard Feelings, Jennifer Lawrence said: ""Everybody in some sense will be offended by this film—you're welcome."" Wishful thinking on her part. Yet the film also reveals how cautious Hollywood studios remain about sex, especially at a time when the cultural politics of the US is torn between an ever-more conservative right wing and the progressive left. No Hard Feelings only pretends to accept it as the plot heads to a sentimental ending about Maddie and Percy finding themselves. In one of the more realistic, funnier scenes, Maddie and her best friend go through worse reasons they've had sex, including not wanting to make the commute home at night. To them, sex is no big deal, so why not get a car out of it? Except in this movie, it is such a big deal that Percy resists. As Owen Gleiberman said in his Variety review: ""No Hard Feelings is the first Hollywood comedy about a teenager losing his virginity in which the teenager in question has no apparent desire to lose his virginity."" It might sound as if No Hard Feelings is playing into the ""Puriteen"" concept: the idea, which many have questioned, that Generation Z doesn't have much sex. Maddie even asks at a high school party, ""Doesn't anyone [have sex] anymore?""—using a common, but unquotable here, term.",Negative
Is there alien debris in the Pacific?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230626-the-underwater-search-for-an-alien-object,"– It's a startling fact that no human has ever personally encountered material from outside our Solar System—at least, not knowingly. Despite 66 years of space exploration and hundreds of missions collecting samples from the moon, solar wind, asteroids and low-earth orbit—as well as the more than 70,000 meteorites that have been found on the surface of our planet—the space debris scattered across the world's museums is all from our own cosmic neighborhood.

How workers win office-return fights,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230622-why-workers-are-still-winning-the-return-to-office-fight,"– ""Over time, workers found a new way of doing things that stuck,"" she says. ""These new habits seemed right and fair, with the work still getting done. So, any sort of change was perceived as a cost: if returning to the office is good for my manager, then it must be bad for me."" Yet, in late 2022, an economic downturn loomed and layoffs ticked up, companies cross-sector began backtracking on flexibility, mandating more in-office days and set schedules. Some firms that had previously confirmed a work-from-anywhere policy, such as the ride-share company Lyft, went back on those promises, and demanded their workers return to the office. Still, even in the current culture of job cuts, many workers are not heeding the call to return to a commuter lifestyle. The ask has often been met with employee backlash, however, even with the power pendulum beginning to swing away from the workforce. At the height of the Great Resignation and ensuing protracted staffing shortages, it made sense for organizations to accommodate employee demands if they wanted to attract and retain staff. As the economy began to slow down in 2022, however, employers regained some power.",Positive
