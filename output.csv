Trump to address a changed America at vital moment for his presidency Few of Donald Trump’s speeches to Congress have had as much riding on them as the one on Tuesday night.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp859d8rn78o,"– President Trump will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night, and it's a big night for him as well. The address represents an opportunity for Trump to stop the bleeding at a pivotal time. In just over eight months, voters will pass judgement on Trump's second presidential term in November's midterm elections, assuring two years of legislative gridlock and aggressive oversight that could, in his own words, see him impeached once again. What to know about Trump's State of the Union address Opinion polls suggest public mood has soured on Trump in his second term. Trump has enacted his sweeping second-term agenda at breakneck speed; cracking down on illegal immigration and effectively sealing the border, upending foreign alliances, challenging the checks and balances that are foundational to the American political system, and fundamentally redefining the role of the presidency.",Positive
"Political outsiders are up against Thailand's powerful patronage system, defeated MP tells BBC The People's Party’s hopes were dashed on the rocks of the old-style patronage networks which dominate provincial politics.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4gxng2y4xo,"– In 2023, Chutiphong Pipoppinyo was part of the ""orange wave"" of idealistic young candidates who stunned Thailand in the 2023 election by winning more seats for the progressive Move Forward party than any other party. This year though, he lost his seat in his home province of Rayong to a rival from an old established family which has traditionally occupied positions of power there. ""In 2023 we were like a storm that swept through and the other parties weren't ready to fight back. The wave of support for Move Forward in the final stretch of that election really encouraged voters to try something new."" Now renamed the People's Party, their hopes that they would improve on their 2023 performance were dashed on the rocks of the old-style patronage networks which have dominated provincial politics in Thailand throughout its modern history. The results are not yet official, and a number of election irregularities are being investigated, but that won't change the overall outcome: a steep drop of more than 20% in the number of seats won by the People's Party, and a remarkable surge by the conservative Bhumjaithai party, increasing its share of seats from 71 in 2023 to an estimated 193 in the 500-seat parliament this year.",Positive

The government says ETAs will streamline the immigration system, speed it up and make it more secure.Getting an ETA costs £16, but the government has said it plans to increase the fee to £20 in the future.An ETA is digitally linked to your passport, so you don't need a paper copy at the border.While an ETA gives you permission to visit the UK, it does not give you the right to enter.British or Irish citizens will not need an ETA or a visa to visit the UK or to travel through it.The scheme was launched in October 2023 but the government says it was ""not strictly enforced to give visitors ample time to adjust to the new requirement.""",Positive

Threat of further violence looms after Mexican cartel rampage,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgml2djwwvno,"– Driving into Mexico's western city of Guadalajara, the evidence of Sunday's terrifying cartel rampage is still visible.The charred debris of burnt cars sits on roadsides and there are scorched patches of asphalt on the highways after the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) - one of the most powerful and feared cartels in the country - set scores of vehicles alight in response to the killing of their boss, Nemesio ""El Mencho"" Oseguera.This and the sight of ransacked or burning convenience stores projected exactly the message the CJNG wanted: that with or without their chief, they remain powerful, with the ability to unleash havoc and chaos on the streets - sowing fear and intimidation on a mass scale.Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has been trying to counter this narrative.The execution of the kingpin strategy in Mexico over the last two decades—the extraction or the killing of major leaders like El Mencho—has always resulted in the same thing: more violence,"" says drug war expert Deborah Bonello, who is the managing editor of the Insight Crime think tank.One of those parts could well be Guadalajara, which is due to host thousands of international football fans for the Fifa World Cup in June.",Negative
