Arjun Sethi, a law professor at George Washington University, said that the social media accounts in the United States and India, as well as some politicians, have used this tragedy to target the entire Sikh community.""This episode should be treated as a singular, tragic event and not be weaponized to target the entire Sikh community,"" Arjun said.",Negative
