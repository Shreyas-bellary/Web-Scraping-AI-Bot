"Trump threatens Russia with tariffs while unveiling Ukraine weapons plan Under the new plan, the US will sell weapons to Nato countries who will send them to Ukraine.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdv20v9lp1o,"– US President Donald Trump has announced the US will send ""top-of-the-line weapons"" to Ukraine via NATO countries, while also threatening Russia with severe tariffs if a deal to end the war is not reached within 50 days.Rutte confirmed the US had decided to ""massively supply Ukraine with what is necessary through NATO"" and that the Europeans would foot the bill. Asked about his relationship with Putin, Trump said that the two speak ""a lot about getting this thing done"" but voiced his displeasure at the fact that ""very nice phone calls"" with the Russian president are often followed by devastating air strikes on Ukraine—which have been growing in intensity and frequency.""If this is all Trump had to say about Ukraine today, then so far it's been much ado about nothing,"" Sen Konstantin Kosachev argued that ""if this is all Trump had to say about Ukraine today, then so far it's been much ado about nothing.""Two rounds of ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine took place earlier this year but no other meetings have so far been scheduled - something Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that he spoke with Trump after his meeting with Rutte, and thanked him for his ""willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.""",Negative
"Trump weapons pledge marks major step forward for Ukraine For the first time since returning to the White House, Trump pledges to make new weapons available to Ukraine.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4y2rv41pyo,"– Donald Trump has promised to make new weapons available to Ukraine.Under a new deal, the US will sell weapons to NATO members who will then supply them to Kyiv as it battles Russia's invasion.The president didn't give too many specifics about what he said was ""billions of dollars' worth of military equipment.""But when asked if the deal included Patriot air defense batteries and interceptor missiles, he replied ""it's everything.""One European country has 17 Patriot systems and ""a big portion"" would soon be on the way to Ukraine, Trump said.Trump threatened Russia with tariffs while unveiling new Ukraine weapons planIt's a novel approach, which Kyiv and members of the US congress have been urging for some time: pressure Russia by targeting countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, like China and India.Trump's move comes as the US Senate continues to work on a bill that would impose much stiffer sanctions.The president said the Senate bill, which envisages 500% secondary tariffs, could be ""very good"" but added that it was ""sort of meaningless after a while because at a certain point it doesn't matter.""This is a significant moment.Less than two weeks ago, there was horror in Kyiv at news that the Pentagon had suspended military shipments to Ukraine, including Patriots.Trump appeared to have guaranteed that the all-important US weapons pipeline to Ukraine will remain open for now—provided others pay for it.But 50 days will feel like a very long time to Ukrainians, who are on the receiving end of near-nightly drone and missile bombardment.Nothing Trump has done seems likely to put an immediate stop to this.",Negative
