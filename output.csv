"Israel says it has begun aid airdrops into Gaza The IDF says seven packages with flour, sugar, and canned food were delivered to Gaza, amid a growing hunger crisis there.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn437jjygl9o,"– Israel's military says it has ""recently"" made an airdrop of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, following weeks of international pressure and a growing hunger crisis in the Palestinian territory.In a statement early on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the airdrop ""included seven packages of aid containing flour, sugar, and canned food."" Israel earlier said it was prepared to open humanitarian corridors to allow UN convoys into Gaza.This came amid calls for Israel to let more aid into Gaza and amid warnings of mass starvation following months of limited supply to the territory's two million people.Israel denied what it called ""the false claim of deliberate starvation"" in Gaza.The military also posted a video purportedly showing a plane dropping the aid.The BBC spoke to several Gazans on Saturday who worried air drops could cause ""serious harm.""When aid is dropped from the air, it risks landing directly on tents, potentially causing serious harm, including injury or even death,"" he said.The IDF said that responsibility for food distribution to the population in Gaza ""lies with the UN and international aid organizations"" and added they must ""ensure that the aid does not reach Hamas.""Israel's apparent concessions on Saturday followed its acceptance of a Jordanian and UAE plan, backed by the UK, to air drop aid into Gaza.The head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, said air drops were ""expensive, inefficient, and can even kill starving civilians"" if they did not go according to plan.Lazzarini said his organization had ""the equivalent of 6,000 trucks"" in Jordan and Egypt waiting to enter Gaza, and urged Israel ""lift the siege, open the gates and guarantee safe movements and dignified access to people in need.""",Negative

Europe accused of going soft on Azerbaijan to avoid buying Russian gas Critics say EU policy has given Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev a free hand during his crackdown on opponents.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7yl59nzro,"– When a young peace activist was jailed for 15 years for high treason in Azerbaijan last month, his friends' anger was directed primarily at the European Union, ahead of the government that put him behind bars.Bahruz Samadov, a 30-year-old PhD student, is facing one of the harshest sentences ever given to a critic of President Ilham Aliyev's 21-year rule.The EU ""may keep flirting with Baku, but silence has its cost"", one critic complained.Shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared Azerbaijan a ""key partner"" in EU efforts to move away from Russian natural gas.President Aliyev has re-established control of the breakaway Karabakh region, causing an exodus of its entire Armenian population; he has also secured a fifth consecutive term in an election widely criticized by monitors, and cracked down on opposition and press freedom.The European Parliament called on the EU last year to impose sanctions on Baku and end reliance on Azerbaijan's gas exports.Europe in this situation does not have a huge amount of credible leverage over Azerbaijan,"" he said.The power will not go out in Europe without Azerbaijani gas, but that is not the point, says Benjamin Godwin, a risk analyst specializing in the Caucasus and Central Asia.President Aliyev has sought to take on a larger role in a region traditionally dominated by Moscow, experts say.He has also long accused international organizations of bias and meddling in domestic politics, and the Baku offices of the UN, the International Red Cross Committee, and the BBC have all been ordered to shut down.",Negative
