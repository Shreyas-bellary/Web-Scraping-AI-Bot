"Israel says it will return to ceasefire after Gaza strikes Israel and Hamas accused one another of breaching the deal, which came into force on 10 October.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2elr16jjqo,"– The Israeli military has said it will resume enforcement of the ceasefire in Gaza after launching air strikes on Sunday in response to what it called Hamas's ""blatant violation"" of the deal.Strikes began in southern Gaza after the Israeli military said ""terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire"" toward its troops in Rafah, killing two soldiers.Hamas said it was ""unaware"" of any clashes in the area under Israeli control.By evening, Israel said it had hit Hamas targets across Gaza, with hospital sources saying 44 people were killed.Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.

"These confederate statues caused nationwide protests. Melted down, they're now art pieces The 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments have been deconstructed and displayed to make a statement on the horrors of slavery.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9x1w2ee1o,"– A massive monument of General Robert E Lee that once sparked riots in the Virginia city of Charlottesville is now a pile of melted-down bronze, artfully displayed in a Los Angeles museum.Around the corner, there is a massive, graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson—the two most famous Confederate generals in the US Civil War, which the Confederacy lost in 1865 and ultimately led to the end of slavery in the United States.""They fought for slavery,"" says curator Hamza Walker, who has been working for eight years to acquire and borrow the massive monuments amid lawsuits and the logistical challenges of moving tens of thousands of pounds of bronze and granite to Los Angeles.""It's a toxic representation of history, this lost cause narrative, and we're purifying it,"" says Jalane Schmidt, an activist and professor who was there when the statue came down in Charlottesville, and when it was melted at a secret foundry.Most of the monuments on display will be returned to the cities and towns they've been borrowed from when the show closes in May.But Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals—even though they lost the war—is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states' rights and not about slavery.""States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,"" he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a ""noble victim"" and that slavery wasn't so terrible.""If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,"" he says.The centerpiece of the show is ""Unmanned Drone""—a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.",Negative
"After 'No Kings' protests, where does Democratic resistance go next? Millions of Americans joined anti-Trump protests, but Democrats are less popular than the president and divided over how to fight back.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3zemk2j4ro,"– It was a moment for likeminded Democrats, liberals, and some anti-Trump Republicans to rally together at a time when the American left has little formal power in national politics. But where do they go from here?By most accounts, the turnout at Saturday's events—in major US cities like Chicago, New York, Washington and Los Angeles, as well as hundreds of smaller towns—was higher than expected and surpassed the first ""No Kings"" rally in June.Congressional Republicans had warned that the demonstrations would be ""anti-American"", and some conservative governors had put their law enforcement and National Guard on alert in case of violence.The massive rallies turned out to be peaceful—a carnival, not carnage.The party still has a long way to go, however.Polls suggest only a third of Americans view it favorably—the lowest for decades—and Democrats are divided over how to mount an effective opposition to Trump when they no longer control either chamber of Congress.The Democrats have been more combative over the ongoing government shutdown, which is about to enter its fourth week.The White House responded to the protests with derision.",Negative
Everything we know about the Louvre jewellery heist The world-famous museum in Paris was closed on Sunday after a masked gang raided one of its galleries.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7nrlkg0zxo,"– Four thieves used a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Two of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and stole items from two glass display cases.The museum's alarms sounded and staff followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors, the culture ministry said in a statement.Culture Minister Rachida told French news outlet TF1 that footage of the theft showed the masked robbers entering ""calmly"" and smashing display cases containing the jewels.The whole raid happened ""very, very fast"", Interior Minister Laurent Nuez told France Inter radio, and was over in less than seven minutes.Nuez described the stolen jewels ""priceless"" and ""of immeasurable heritage value.""",Negative
"Stolen treasures, a crown dropped as thieves fled - and serious questions for Louvre security The most spectacular Louvre robbery since the Mona Lisa in 1911 proves the vulnerability of French museums, writes Hugh Schofield.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0e24rrjz1o,"– It is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911.And it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs.According to France's new interior minister Laurent Nuez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional.They knew what they wanted, had evidently ""cased the joint"" in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away.In a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window.Inside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels.Most of France's royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back.Two recent museum thefts in France had already alerted the authorities to the growing audacity of art gangs, and a security plan drawn up by the culture ministry is gradually being put into effect across France.",Positive

Trump said because the US offers ""large scale payments and subsidies"" and Petro ""does nothing"" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer ""payment or subsidies"" to Colombia.",Negative
