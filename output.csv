Violent Channel smuggling gang's French and UK network exposed by undercover BBC investigation Exclusive: Secret filming reveals smugglers' forest hideout and cash deals at UK train station.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48nmmzdro,"– A BBC investigation has exposed the French and UK operations of a powerful and violent smuggling gang taking people across the English Channel in small boats.A reporter, posing as a migrant wanting to cross, helped us gain unprecedented access to the smugglers' notorious forest hideout in northern France—an area plagued by armed battles between rival gangs.Secret filming at a major UK railway station also captured associates of the gang collecting cash payments to secure migrant places on illegal Channel crossings.Two men met us on separate occasions on the busy concourse at Birmingham's New Street Station to collect envelopes containing hundreds of pounds.Multiple sources have described how gang leaders, who keep one step ahead of the authorities by changing mobile phone numbers and the gang's name, subjected their henchmen and migrants to violent beatings.The findings are the culmination of months of undercover fieldwork and the creation of multiple fake identities to engage with the smugglers.Our investigation began in April 2024, after we witnessed French police trying to stop the gang from launching an inflatable boat into the Channel.Deadly gun battles and stabbings are not uncommon here, particularly during the summer, as gangs settle scores and compete over the lucrative and highly competitive small-boat people-smuggling industry.Abdullah would even try to convince our reporting team that he was just another desperate person trying to reach the UK, rather than a smuggler making hundreds of thousands of pounds by risking people's lives in the Channel.",Negative
"Despite Trump's peace calls, Russian attacks on Ukraine double since inauguration Missile and drone attacks on Ukraine are now higher than at any other point of the war, according to Ukrainian data.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yl6eegv63o,"– Russia has more than doubled the number of drones and missiles fired towards Ukraine since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, a BBC Verify analysis has found, despite his calls for a ceasefire.Attacks had already been rising under former President Joe Biden in 2024 but climbed sharply after Trump's election victory in November.Since he returned to office in January, recorded aerial attacks from Moscow have reached their highest levels of the war.The data reviewed by BBC Verify—based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force—show that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January—when Trump's presidency began—and 19 July, compared to 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term.""This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long,"" White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks.""It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites,"" he said.The growing attacks have renewed calls for the US to send fresh supplies of Patriot anti-air batteries to Ukraine.",Negative
"Propaganda or fair warning? Taiwanese TV show imagines Chinese invasion Zero Day Attack wants to raise awareness of China's threat, but has also been accused of fearmongering.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93ge90dywo,"– A Chinese fighter jet plane crashes in the waters off Taiwan's coast, prompting Chinese warships to blockade the island for a ""search and rescue.""Taiwanese soldiers manning Dadan Island, a rocky outcrop mere kilometres from China's coast, begin vanishing mysteriously.This is the key scenario in Zero Day Attack, a new Taiwanese television show about a fictional Chinese military invasion.

Watch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain Texas Republicans have proposed a controversial redistricting plan. The BBC's Bernd Debusmann explains gerrymandering... in just 60 seconds.,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c776n1edzm2o,"– Texas Republicans have proposed a redistricting plan, backed by President Trump, that would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives—a practice known as gerrymandering. The proposal comes long before congressional lines are scheduled to be redrawn, following the next US Census. As a result, several Democratic states such as California, New York, and Illinois have said they are also pushing forward with their own efforts to redraw their districts to create more Democratic seats. But what is gerrymandering, and how does it work? The BBC's Bernd Debusmann takes a look at the practice with a sweet analogy.",Positive

"Stay or go? Under Trump, dreams fade for Chinese who trekked to US Migrants living in unease under President Trump have quietly begun to ask themselves: is America worth it?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd97e120xe5o,"– When Pan decided to leave his homeland in early 2023, he did so with a conviction that his future no longer belonged there.As he headed to America, he dreamed of a freer society, a fairer economy, and a life lived with dignity—things he said he could never claim in China, where his home had been forcibly demolished by the local government to make way for real estate development.To chase that dream, he embarked on a journey of thousands of miles from China to Ecuador in 2023, from which point he trekked jungles as part of his long route.Pan is one of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals who have made the same journey in recent years. Known colloquially as zou xian ke, or ""those who walked the line"", they represent a new wave of migration driven by authoritarian tightening at home and the belief—sometimes naive, often desperate—that the US still offers a fair shot at a better life.Their reasons for exodus varied, but their experiences once on American soil follow certain trends: many have ended up isolated by language, burdened by debt and surviving on gig work as they wait for their asylum claims to crawl through an overwhelming immigration system.James was always a hustler in China.But after Covid tanked the economy and political crackdowns left little room to breathe, he decided to leave.""At least your hard work here brings hope, but back in China, you could work over ten hours a day and see no future,"" James told me.",Negative
How a Texas showdown could reshape Congress - and Trump's presidency A dramatic redistricting fight could spread to other states before next year's crucial midterm elections.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2q7egqrpdo,– Dozens of Texas Democrats have secretly left the state in a dramatic effort to stop Republicans from holding a vote that could determine the balance of power in the US Congress.Republican Governor Greg Abbot has issued orders that they be arrested on sight—and fined $500 a day.He has also threatened to expel them from office.The Democrats left because at least two-thirds of the 150-member legislative body must be present to proceed with a vote on re-drawing Texas's electoral map.The plan would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing—but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections.It wouldn't take much of a shift in the political winds for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections.This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing—but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections.,Negative

Kennedy has taken a number of steps to transform how the nation's health department develops and regulates vaccines.",Negative
The real reason weather forecasters (like me) often appear to get it wrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1epz58pyo,"– In the 1990s, a weather event needed to be larger than about 100 miles before it could be fully observed—now, the UK-wide weather model used by the Met Office can map weather events as small as 2 miles (3km), Prof Bentley says.But zooming in beyond that size remains difficult, so predicting weather like heavy fog—which might affect only a 1km space—is particularly tricky.Over my career, forecasting has improved almost beyond recognition.So why, with our wealth of knowledge and our powerful forecasting technology, do some people still perceive the weather as incorrect? And do we really get it wrong or is something more complicated at play around how we share forecasts? Part of the challenge is around expectations, which have risen in our world of round-the-clock access to information.We can tweak the temperature of our fridge or identify a problem in our car from our smartphones in a fraction of a second.So why can't we find out whether it's going to rain on our street at 2pm on Sunday with 100% accuracy— surely, an easier feat?""",Positive
