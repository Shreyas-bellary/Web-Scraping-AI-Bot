"Trump says 'good prospect' of summit with Putin and Zelensky after envoy's Russia visit Expectations for a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv are muted, despite the US president's threat of sweeping sanctions.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5rdl1y8ndo,"– Donald Trump has said there is a ""good chance"" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, following what he described as ""very good talks"" between his envoy and Vladimir Putin earlier in the day.Asked at the White House whether the two leaders had agreed to such a summit, the US president said there was a ""very good prospect"" but did not give further details.The Kremlin earlier issued a vague statement about the talks between Putin and Steve Witkoff, with a foreign policy aide saying the two sides had exchanged ""signals"" as part of ""constructive"" talks in Moscow. Wednesday's discussions between Putin and Witkoff appeared cordial despite Trump's mounting irritation with the lack of progress in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.Trump's comments in the Oval Office on Wednesday come after he posted on his Truth Social platform that he had briefed some of America's European allies following the talks.""Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,"" Trump said.The White House also told the BBC that Russia had expressed a desire to meet the US president and that he was ""open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelensky.""Expectations are muted for a settlement by Friday, and Russia has continued its large-scale air attacks on Ukraine despite Trump's threats of sanctions.Before taking office in January, Trump said he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in a day.",Positive
The secret system Hamas uses to pay government salaries Observers are baffled at how Hamas can pay officials as Gaza is isolated and largely reduced to rubble.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kz42j92jmo,"– Hamas' military capability is severely weakened and its political leadership under intense pressure. Yet, throughout the war Hamas has managed to continue to use a secret cash-based payment system to pay 30,000 civil servants' salaries totalling $7m (£5.3m).The BBC has spoken to three civil servants who have confirmed they have received nearly $300 each within the last week.It's believed they are among tens of thousands of employees who have continued to receive a maximum of just over 20% of their pre-war salary every 10 weeks.Severe food shortages—which aid agencies blame on Israeli restrictions—and rising cases of acute malnutrition continue in Gaza, where a kilogramme of flour in recent weeks has cost as much as $80—an all-time high.It remains unclear how Hamas has managed to continue funding salary payments given the destruction of much of its administrative and financial infrastructure.One senior Hamas employee, who served in high positions and is familiar with Hamas's financial operations, told the BBC that the group had stockpiled approximately $700m in cash and hundreds of millions of shekels in underground tunnels prior to the group's deadly 7 October 2023 attack in southern Israel, which sparked the devastating Israeli military campaign.",Negative

How a cartoon skull became a symbol of defiance in Indonesia Some lawmakers say the black skull flags from the Japanese anime One Piece threaten national unity.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ezvj4d111o,"– In the popular Japanese anime One Piece, black flags bearing a skull with a straw hat are carried by a rowdy crew of pirates who have made it their mission to challenge a draconian regime and fight for freedom.But in July, these emblems started popping up across Indonesia—along doorways, on the backs of cars, and painted on walls.For many, it was a response to Indonesian leader Prabowo Subianto's call for Indonesians to fly their national red and white flag ahead of the country's Independence Day on 17 August.The series has a large and dedicated fan base in Indonesia, where Japanese anime is well loved.In the same way the pirates in the series, led by their leader Monkey D, raise the Jolly Rogers as a symbol of freedom against their government, some Indonesian residents say raising the flag is a ""symbol that we love this country, but don't completely agree with its policies.""Red represents the blood shed for our independence, white represents the purity of our souls,"" Prabowo had said. Deputy House Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, widely regarded as Prabowo's right-hand man, described the movement as ""a coordinated attempt to divide the nation.""But on Tuesday, the country's state secretary minister for Prasetyo Hadi said the president himself had ""no objection"" to the flags as a form of ""creative expression.""However, it should not be used to challenge or diminish the significance of the red and white flag.Police in the capital Jakarta have said they are ""monitoring the use of non-national flags and symbols that don't align with the spirit of nationalism, including pirate or fictional-themed flags.""",Positive
"People returned to live in Pompeii's ruins, archaeologists say New evidence suggests an informal settlement was established after the eruption that buried much of the city.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62wx23y2v1o,"– New evidence suggests people returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii after the ancient Roman city was devastated by a volcanic eruption.Archaeologists believe some survivors who could not afford to start a new life elsewhere returned to the site and may have been joined by others looking for a place to settle. Pompeii was home to more than 20,000 people before Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79, burying—and preserving—much of the city, before its rediscovery in the 16th century.There had been previous speculation that survivors had returned to the ruins, and archaeologists at the site said in a statement on Wednesday that the theory appears to have been confirmed by new research. ""Thanks to the new excavations, the picture is now clearer: post-79 Pompeii reemerges, less as a city than as a precarious and grey agglomeration, a kind of camp, a favela among the still-recognisable ruins of the Pompeii that once was,"" the site's director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, said.The evidence suggests people lived without the infrastructure and services typical of a Roman city, and that the ruins provided the opportunity of finding valuable objects, the researchers said.",Negative
"Trump orders India tariff hike to 50% for buying Russian oil India, which now faces among the highest tariff rates imposed by the US, called the levy ""unjustified and unreasonable"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dxr1g4y7yo,"– President Trump has issued an executive order hitting India with an additional 25% tariff over its purchases of Russian oil. That will raise the total tariff on Indian imports to the United States to 50%—among the highest rates imposed by the US. The new rate will come into effect in 21 days, so on 27 August, according to the executive order. India's foreign ministry on Wednesday said Delhi had already made clear its stance on imports from Russia, and reiterated that the tariff is ""unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable.""India has previously called Trump's threat to raise tariffs over its purchase of oil from Russia ""unjustified and unreasonable.""Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have in the past referred to each other as friends and, during Trump's first term, attended political rallies in each others' countries.But that has not stopped Trump from hitting India with the levies, suggesting diverging interests between New Delhi and Washington.The Federation of India Exports Organizations has called the decision to impose additional tariffs ""extremely shocking"", adding that it will hit 55% of India's exports to America.The tariffs are expected to make Indian goods far costlier in the US, and could cut US-bound exports by 40%–50%, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.""India should remain calm, avoid retaliation for at least six months, and recognize that meaningful trade negotiations with the US cannot proceed under threats or mistrust,"" former Indian trade official and head of Ipler, Ajay Srivastava, said.India has previously criticized the US—its largest trading partner—for introducing the levies, when the US itself is still doing trade with Russia.",Positive
'It's scary': Childcare abuse cases panic Australian parents The string of alleged crimes in daycare centres have prompted urgent calls for reform.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp1x028r9o,"– ""It's that old adage of cockroaches—if you see one in your house, there's 10 that you don't see. These are the ones that get caught. It's more scary the ones that you can't see,"" he tells the BBC. Australia is still reeling from the crimes of childcare worker Ashley Paul Griffith—dubbed ""one of Australia's worst paedophiles""—who was late last year sentenced to life in prison for raping and sexually abusing almost 70 girls.The series of allegations have sparked panic and fear among parents, child safety advocates have demanded action to fix what they call a dangerously incompetent system, and politicians have promised reform to keep Australia's most vulnerable safe.""Some childcare centers are still safe, but the current childcare system is definitely not working to protect children or prioritise their safety,"" says Hetty Johnston, a leading child protection advocate.It's all about reducing opportunities for predators to isolate or conceal in disinterested and sensitive duties.''",Negative
Could RFK Jr's move to pull mRNA vaccine funding be a huge miscalculation? The US is withdrawing $500m for vaccines for diseases like flu and Covid. Health correspondent James Gallagher asks if it's the right call.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly75p9yd67o,"– mRNA vaccines were heralded as a medical marvel that saved lives during the Covid pandemic, but now the US is pulling back from researching them.US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has cancelled 22 projects—worth $500m (£376m) in funding—for tackling infections such as Covid and flu.So does Kennedy—probably the country's most famous vaccine sceptic—have a point, or is he making a monumental miscalculation?Prof Adam Finn, vaccine researcher at the University of Bristol, says ""it's a bit of both"" but ditching mRNA technology is ""stupid"" and potentially a ""catastrophic error.""Kennedy says he has reviewed the science on mRNA vaccines, concluding that the ""data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.""But to swing the pendulum so far that mRNA is useless and has no value and should not be developed or understood better is equally stupid, it did do remarkable things,"" he says.The pandemic was an era when the world was single-mindedly focused on Covid and the rollout of vaccines was monitored intensely.The same measles or HPV vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case.The vaccines were shown to provide protection—keeping people alive and out of hospital—in both clinical trials and then during intense monitoring of how the vaccines performed when they were rolled out around the world.The mRNA vaccines performed better than the inactivated ones when tackling Covid.",Positive

Suspect in shooting of Israel embassy couple faces hate crime and murder charges,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz2gy48kvo,"– Prosecutors have formally charged a suspect in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington DC in May with hate crimes and first-degree murder. Along with the nine-count federal indictment against Elias Rodriguez, 31, the US Department of Justice filed legal findings that could allow the death penalty to be pursued in the case. Prosecutors say Rodriguez opened fire on couple Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, outside the Capital Jewish Museum before shouting ""Free Palestine"" during his arrest. Rodriguez, who is from Chicago, had expressed support for violence against Israelis, including in social media posts where he allegedly wrote: ""Death to Israel.""Prosecutors say he traveled from Chicago to the Washington DC area on 20 May with a handgun.
