"Inside Gaza, BBC sees total devastation after two years of war With endless rubble and destroyed streets as far as the eye can see, any plans for Gaza's future are a far cry from where it is today, writes Lucy Williamson.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rp4lrdv8ko,"– ""It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,"" he said. ""This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that."" The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.""Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,"" he told me.Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw—""a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web"" they said—some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.""It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,"" he said.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with US support.",Positive
"Conservative justices sharply question Trump tariffs in high-stakes hearing If the court rules against Trump's tariffs, it could force the US to refund some of the billions it has collected.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp3nj5nj3o,"– President Trump's use of sweeping tariffs faced sharp questioning at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, in a case with major implications for the president's agenda and the global economy.A majority of justices, including several conservatives, expressed doubts about the White House's justification of the import duties, which the president has said are necessary to restore America's manufacturing base and fix its trade imbalance.The measures are being challenged by a number of small businesses and a group of states, which contend that the president has overstepped his authority in imposing the levies, which are in effect a tax.America's top court - which has a 6-3 conservative majority - usually takes months to reach big decisions, but many expect it to move faster in this case, which is also seen as the first major test of the Trump administration's push to expand presidential power.The justices spent relatively little time on questions about refunds or whether the president's emergency declarations were warranted.Trump first invoked IEEPA in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.John Roberts said.Under the Constitution, America's founding legal document, Congress, not the president, holds the power to tax and the court has traditionally set limits in how much of that authority it can hand over.If the court ruled for Trump in this case, Judge Neil Gorsuch, another conservative, wondered: ""What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce?""",Positive
"Mexico president to seek charges after being groped on street Claudia Sheinbaum says she is pressing charges because ""a line must be drawn"" against the harassment of Mexican women.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pgev02pno,"– Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken.The offender has been arrested.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City.She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman.Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels.",Negative
Wife of abducted Malaysian pastor wins landmark lawsuit against state The high court held the government and police liable for what will be the largest sum for damages in Malaysian history.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797r2d3nwyo,"– The wife of a Malaysian pastor abducted eight years ago has won a lawsuit against the police and the government, in a landmark case that has gripped the nation.Raymond Koh was pulled out of his car by masked men in a suburb of the capital Kuala Lumpur in 2017. His whereabouts remain unknown—his family has long maintained he was taken by police.On Wednesday, the high court ruled he had been forcibly disappeared, with the judge holding the government and police responsible for his abduction. It is Malaysia's first such judgement.The court also ruled the state must pay at least 31m ringgit (£5.7m; $7.4m) in damages, which would likely benefit Mr Koh's family.Both cases took place within months of each other between the end of 2016 and early 2017, and led to heated public speculation.Mr Koh's case, in particular, dominated the headlines because his abduction took place in broad daylight and had been captured on a CCTV camera, and was witnessed by passers-by.Both investigations eventually concluded that the men had likely been abducted by the elite Special Branch of the police as they were perceived as threats to mainstream Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia.Besides awarding several million ringgit to Ms Liew for emotional distress, the judge ruled that 10,000 ringgit (£1,830; $2,385) in general damages be paid for each day of Mr Koh's disappearance, starting from when he was abducted and ending on the day his whereabouts are disclosed by the state.The judge also ordered the state to reopen the investigation and ascertain Mr Koh's whereabouts.",Negative
Why the fall of Pokrovsk would matter to Ukraine and Russia The battle for this strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the Donetsk region has been going on for well over a year.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdv0623pno,"– Ukraine could be facing its biggest loss for months, if the key eastern city of Pokrovsk falls to Russian forces. The battle for this strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the Donetsk region has been going on for well over a year.If Russia's Vladimir Putin were able to claim victory there, three years and 10 months into his full-scale war, he would be a step closer to his goal of controlling Ukraine's entire industrial east - the Donbas, made up of the neighboring regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Claims and counter-claims abound, so it is difficult to say. But we do know Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops in the area, and hundreds of its soldiers have infiltrated the city in the past few weeks, gradually taking over buildings and streets and overwhelming Ukrainian positions.On Wednesday, Kyiv denied its forces in and around the town had been encircled and maintained they were still involved in ""active resistance"" and blocking out Russian troops.The battle for this strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the Donetsk region has been going on for well over a year.If Pokrovsk falls, defending its satellite city of Myrnohrad becomes almost untenable and Russian troops would then be able to turn their focus to the battle for Kostyantynivka to the north-east and the rest of the so-called ""fortress belt"" cities of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Ukraine still had defensive lines to withdraw to and could reset its defense, said analyst Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",Negative
Democrats hit back and a winning message - four election night takeaways It was an encouraging night for the Democratic Party who scored some decisive wins. Here's what we learned.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40qx532e0o,"– The Democrats notched key victories as they swept the first major elections of Trump's second term.Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia, flipping the governorship from Republican, while Mikie Sherrill was elected governor in New Jersey.Both won decisively, securing more than 56% of the vote.In New York City, Zohran Mamdani beat independent Andrew Cuomo and became the first candidate to pass one million votes since 1969.Exit poll data from the major US networks indicated that in all three races the most important issue for voters was the economy and affordability.And tellingly, according to exit poll data from the BBC's US partner CBS News, a majority of voters who named the economy as their most important issue voted for the Democratic candidate in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.It may well give the party a message to coalesce around ahead of the crucial midterm elections next year - and pose a challenge for Republicans to counter.The affordability message cuts across demographics and highlights a major vulnerability for Republicans,"" political communications expert Andrew Koneschusky told the AFP news agency.",Positive

"US to cut flights at 40 airports if shutdown doesn't end, transportation secretary warns",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kp8dex14xo,"– Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned there will be a 10% reduction in air travel capacity at 40 major airports in the US starting Friday morning, if the government shutdown continues.The decision was made because air traffic controllers have been reporting issues with fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said at a briefing with Duffy on Wednesday.""It is unusual, just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual,"" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford during the shutdown, now the longest in US history, controllers have had to keep working without pay, prompting some to call out sick or take side jobs.The flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters reported after the announcement, citing four unnamed sources.Duffy warned earlier this week that the flight cancellations may be coming, as half of the country's 30 major airports experience staff shortages.The names of the affected airports—all high-traffic locations—will be released on Thursday, the officials said.The cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day.Duffy said air travel is still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency.",Negative
Miss Universe contestants walk out after organiser berates Miss Mexico,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40q990g28o,"– Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation.At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her.Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online.Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood.Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited ""as much as possible"" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking ""legal actions"" against him.""I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,"" Mr Rocha said.Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited ""as much as possible"" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking ""legal actions"" against him.""If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologize to everyone.I especially apologized to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.""Ms Bosch later said in an interview: ""I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard.It's here stronger than ever.I have a purpose.I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.""",Negative
