"Senate clears Trump pick Miran to  Fed board ahead of key interest rate vote His entry has raised concerns over the Fed's independence, following Trump's bid to reshape the central bank.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrq5x97qlqo,"– The US Senate has cleared President Trump's pick Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve's board of governors - part of a panel responsible for setting the country's interest rates.Miran, who is chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board since its creation in its current form in the 1930s.He was narrowly confirmed on Monday with a vote of 48-47.The economist's entry has raised concerns over the central bank's longstanding independence and follows Trump's bid to reshape the Federal Reserve. Miran is expected to take part in a key Fed policy meeting this week as one of 12 voting members, playing a central role in Trump's bid for a large interest rate cut.The Fed is expected to approve a quarter-percentage point rate cut to support a weakening labor market.Miran is a supporter of Trump's global tariffs, arguing the import duties won't fuel inflation and that policies like stricter immigration will reduce housing demand and lower prices.The White House economist's fast-tracked confirmation vote has proceeded in just a few weeks, when it typically takes months for a Fed governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, raised concerns that Miran would be seen as a ""puppet"" who would not be trusted as an independent voice on the Fed board.Trump has put pressure on the Fed for months, demanding interest rate cuts to give the US economy a boost and make it cheaper for the government to borrow.Miran's vote also comes as Trump is also attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and constitutional powers to remove her.",Positive

Does Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza? BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams looks at parallels between reactions to Israel and apartheid-era South Africa.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xe5v70evo,"– Israel's international isolation appears to be deepening.Is it approaching a ""South Africa moment"", when a combination of political pressure, economic, sporting and cultural boycotts helped to force Pretoria to abandon apartheid?Or can the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu weather the diplomatic storm, leaving Israel free to pursue its goals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank without causing permanent damage to its international standing?""Two former prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have already accused Netanyahu of turning Israel into an international pariah.Thanks to a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, the number of countries Netanyahu can travel to without the risk of being arrested has shrunk dramatically.At the UN, several countries, including Britain, France, Australia, Belgium and Canada, have said they are planning to recognize Palestine as a state next week.And Gulf countries, reacting with fury to last Tuesday's Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar, have been meeting in Doha to discuss a unified response, with some calling on countries which enjoy relations with Israel to think again.But with images of starvation emerging from Gaza over the summer and the Israeli army poised to invade - and quite possibly destroy - Gaza City, more and more European governments are showing their displeasure in ways that go beyond mere statements.Even Netanyahu admitted on Monday that Israel is facing ""a kind of economic isolation on the world stage.""",Negative

Musk buys $1bn worth of Tesla shares,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp982z3xrz7o,"– Billionaire Elon Musk has scooped up roughly $1bn (£735m) worth of Tesla shares, in what is being seen as a vote of confidence in the electric car maker. Shares in Tesla, which have struggled to advance this year, jumped more than 6% in early trading on the news.Musk already held a roughly 13% stake in the company, but he has long sought more control of the firm, which he has been pushing to invest in robotaxis, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI).The company's board recently proposed a compensation plan valued at roughly $1 trillion, which would grant Musk up to 12% of the firm's shares if the company reaches certain targets. Musk's purchases of roughly 2.5 million shares were completed on Friday and disclosed in a filing with regulators on Monday.They mark his first open market stock purchases since 2020 and are a sign of his investment in the firm, which has been on the defensive this year. Musk has tried to focus investors on the promise of robotaxis and automation.Asked about those assurances in an interview with Bloomberg last week, board chair Robyn Denholm said ""what [Musk] does from a personal perspective in terms of his political motivations, et cetera, is up to him.""An inventive and ungenerous interpretation of Musk's actions is he saw the news about Larry Ellison becoming the world's richest man and decided to juice Tesla stock a bit to regain the title,"" she said.",Positive
