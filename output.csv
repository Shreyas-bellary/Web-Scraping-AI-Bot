Witkoff has been visiting Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government faces mounting pressure over the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Gaza.UN agencies have warned there is man-made, mass starvation in Gaza, and have blamed Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies to the territory.Hamas—a proscribed terror group in the US, UK, and EU—said in its statement that it could not yield its right to ""resistance and its weapons"" unless an ""independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital"" was established.The Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) Lt Gen Eyal Zamir warned on Friday that there would be no respite in fighting in Gaza if negotiations failed to quickly secure the release of hostages being held by Hamas.And on Saturday, the family of hostage Evyatar David issued a statement after Hamas released a video showing him shirtless and emaciated in a dimly-lit tunnel.",Negative

"The mystery of Winston Churchill's dead platypus was unsolved - until now The question of who, or what, really killed the puggle has eluded the world since 1943.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglzl1ez283o,"– In 1943, a camouflaged ship set off from Australia to England carrying top secret cargo—a single young platypus. Named after his would-be owner, UK prime minister Winston Churchill, the rare monotreme was an unprecedented gift from a country desperately trying to curry favor as World War II expanded into the Pacific and arrived on its doorstep.Fearing a potential diplomatic incident, Winston's death—along with his very existence—was swept under the rug.He was preserved, stuffed and quietly shelved inside his name-sake's office, with rumors that he died of Nazi-submarine-induced shell-shock gently whispered into the ether.Accessing archives in both Canberra and London, the Monash University student found a bunch of records from the ship's crew, including an interview with the platypus attendant charged with keeping Winston alive.It was so obvious that, but for the misfortunes of war, a fine, thriving, healthy little platypus would have created history in being number one of its kind to take up residence in England.""Imagine any man carrying the responsibilities Churchill did, with humanity on the taxidermy rack in Europe and Asia, finding time to even think about, let alone want, half-a-dozen duckbilled platypuses,"" he wrote in his 1980 book Paradoxical Platypus.""A small animal equipped with a nerve-packed, super sensitive bill, able to detect even the delicate movements of a mosquito wriggler on stream bottoms in the dark of night, cannot hope to cope with man-made enormities such as violent explosions.""It was so obvious that, but for the misfortunes of war, a fine, thriving, healthy little platypus would have created history in being number one of its kind to take up residence in England.""It is a tempting story, isn't it?""

The hostage's family also urged the Israeli government and the world community to do ""everything possible to save Evyatar.""In the video released by Hamas, Evyatar David is heard saying ""I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water"" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.The health ministry said the total number of malnutrition deaths since the start of the war has reached 169, including 93 children.Also on Saturday in Gaza, the health ministry said at least 83 had been killed and 1,079 injured as a result of Israel's military offensive in the past 24 hours.Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat told the BBC it had received the bodies of three people killed by Israeli forces near an aid distribution point on Salah al-Din street, south of the Wadi Gaza area in central Gaza, run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

"Melting glaciers threaten to wipe out European villages - is the steep cost to protect them worth it? Switzerland spends almost $500m a year on protective structures. Is it worth it - or, as some suggest, should people move away from the mountain villages at risk?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4w9ggzxv4o,"– Two months ago, his home, three miles away in Blatten, was wiped off the map when part of the mountain and glacier collapsed into the valley.The village's 300 residents had been evacuated days earlier, after geologists warned that the mountain was increasingly unstable.But they lost their homes, their church, their hotels and their farms.Lukas Kalbermatten also lost the hotel that had been in his family for three generations.""The feeling of the village, all the small alleys through the houses, the church, the memories you had when you played there as a child... all this is gone.""Today, he is living in borrowed accommodation in the village of Wiler.Mr Bellwald is a mayor, but this isn't his village.The good news is, he believes the site can be cleared by 2028, with the first new houses ready by 2029.But it comes with a hefty pricetag.Rebuilding Blatten is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps as much as $1 million per resident.Voluntary contributions from the public quickly raised millions of Swiss francs to help those who had lost their homes.I think what should be worrying us is that these events are becoming more frequent, but also more unpredictable.""It is not the very first time that we're seeing big landslides in the Alps,"" says Mr Huss.",Negative
"Steve Rosenberg: Russia is staying quiet on Trump's nuclear move The US president said he's ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia, after a social media spat with Russia's ex-president.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4kgv9238o,"– President Donald Trump, offended by posts by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, says he's ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.So, bizarrely, might Donald Trump's latest submarine deployment be a precursor to a US-Russia summit?I wouldn't go that far.But the reaction from the Russian authorities has been interesting.At time of writing, there hasn't been any.Medvedev said some things that are very bad, talking about nuclear.When you mention the word nuclear my eyes light up and I say we better be careful, because it's the ultimate threat.""But Medvedev has long been accused of nuclear sabre-rattling via social media.Trump had been sparring with Medvedev on social media for several days.After the US president had reduced his 50-day deadline for Russia to end its war in Ukraine to less than two weeks, Medvedev posted that Trump was ""playing the ultimatum game with Russia... Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.""Trump responded: ""Tell Medvedev, the failed former Russian president who thinks he is still in power, to be careful what he says. He is entering very dangerous territory.""Medvedev's next post contained a reference to ""Dead Hand"", the automatic nuclear retaliation system developed in the Soviet Union.Clearly, that did not go down well with the White House chief.Trump had been sparring with Medvedev on social media for several days.",Negative
