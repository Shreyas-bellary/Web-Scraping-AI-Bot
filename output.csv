Inside Australia's billion dollar bid to take on China's rare earth dominance Recent moves by Beijing have got businesses worried - and Australia is looking to offer an alternative.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm2z91mvlvo,"– Australia's bet on the future.Earlier this year, carmakers and other manufacturers around the world rushed to their war rooms, alarmed that China's tight export controls on rare earth magnets—crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defense equipment—could cripple production.Ford was forced to halt production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants—a bold move for a major automaker already grappling with pressure from Trump's tariffs.Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,"" Professor Eksteen explains.China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defense industries,"" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site.Rare earths are critical, however.Take the average electric vehicle—there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windshield wipers and breaking sensors.The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact ""somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck"", Professor Eksteen adds.Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing.Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable.",Positive
