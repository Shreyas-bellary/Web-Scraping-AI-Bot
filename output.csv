Trump's ceasefire pivot will have caused dismay in Kyiv and Europe The US president demanded a ceasefire before he met Putin. His change of mind flies in the face of what Europe and Ukraine want.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvd2jpy1no,"– President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin didn't produce a deal in Alaska, but it was always the most likely and, in the absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, perhaps the most desirable outcome.But US President Donald Trump's pivot away from the need for an immediate ceasefire, which he said beforehand he wanted, will have caused profound dismay in Kyiv and around Europe.Russia's position has long been that a ceasefire can only come in the context of a comprehensive settlement taking account of Russia's interests - and inevitably implies Ukraine's capitulation.This appears to fly in the face of Ukraine's main demand, endorsed by all its European backers: that an unconditional ceasefire has to come first.Europe's 'Trump whisperers' picked up this morning where they left off last week.They highlighted the vital importance of involving Ukraine in conversations about its future but also paused, as they know they must regularly do, to show appreciation for Trump's efforts.""President Trump's efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" said Sir Keir Starmer, the UK's prime minister.Starmer said he welcomed what he called the ""openness"" of the US, along with Europe, to provide ""robust security guarantees"" for Ukraine in the event of a deal.Zelensky posted, adding ""it is important that America's strength has an impact on the situation.""If and when the fighting does eventually end, the precise nature of those guarantees will need to be spelled out in a great deal more detail than has so far been the case.",Positive
