Antarctic glacier's rapid retreat sparks scientific 'whodunnit' A new study suggests that changes to Hektoria Glacier are unprecedented - but not all scientists agree.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04gq00xyeeo,"– When an Antarctic glacier was sparked into rapid retreat three years ago, it left scientists scratching their heads as to what might have caused it.Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8km (5 miles) in just two months in late 2022—and now a new study claims to have the answer.The authors believe that Hektoria could be the first modern example of a process where the front of a glacier resting on the seabed rapidly destabilises.That could lead to much faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere in Antarctica, they say.But other scientists argue that this part of the glacier was actually floating in the ocean—so while the changes are impressive, they are not so unusual.This extraordinary change, the authors say, could be thanks to an ice plain—a relatively flat area of bedrock on which the glacier rests lightly.Upward forces from the ocean water could 'lift' the thinning ice essentially all at once, they argue—causing icebergs to break off and the glacier to retreat in quick time.""The circumstances may be a little particular, but this rapid retreat shows us what may happen elsewhere in Antarctica where glaciers are lightly grounded, and sea-ice loses its grip,"" he added.The location of the grounding line may sound trivial, but it is crucial to determine whether the change was truly unprecedented.""What we see at Hektoria is a small glacier, but if something like that were to happen in other areas of Antarctica, it could play a much larger role in the rate of sea-level rise,"" said Dr Ochwat.",Positive
