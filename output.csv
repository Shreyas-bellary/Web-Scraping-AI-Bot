"'Lives are at stake:' Deadly Texas storms put spotlight on Trump's weather agency cuts While experts say the weather agency performed well, they warn it is operating far below staffing needs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx23ye0xnnyo,"– Experts say the National Weather Service issued alerts in a timely manner over the weekend, the deadly incident carries warnings about what could happen if the NWS and NOAA are not properly staffed and funded in the future.""The Weather Service did a good job with the information you had here. I don't think the staffing cuts contributed to this,"" said Andy Hazelton, a climate scientist who was laid off from NOAA where he modelled hurricane paths.But this is the kind of event we can see more of if the cuts to NOAA continue, if you make the models worse or have the staffing levels lower,"" said Tom Fahy, legislative director of the National Weather Service Employees Organization.Since February, the weather service has lost about 600 staff through a combination of firings, early retirements, and deferred resignations, said Mr Fahy, from meteorologists to technical specialists to hydrologists, who specialize in flooding.The San Antonio office, which played a leading role in forecasting last week's deadly rainstorms, has about an 18% vacancy rate, according to a tally of open roles on its website.But it had ""additional forecasters on duty during the catastrophic flooding event"", NWS spokeswoman Erica Grow Cei said in a statement.Mr Hazelton, who now works at the University of Miami, said it is essential for public safety that NOAA continues to invest in research into more accurate weather and climate models.NOAA has proposed cutting its budget by about $1.8bn for the 2026 fiscal year, according to a report it submitted to US Congress, and planned to reduce staff by about 17%, according to Fed News.",Negative
"Are India's skies safe? Air safety watchdog responds amid rising concerns India’s skies remain safe, with accident rates below global averages, air safety regulator chief tells the BBC.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnr828z0go,"– Just how safe are India's skies? It's a question many are asking after June's devastating Air India crash, which killed at least 270 people.The Economic Times newspaper found that the aviation regulator had recently summoned the airline's leadership after a series of alarming findings—not from routine audits, but triggered by a British aviation firm.The newspaper reported that it began earlier this year when two of SpiceJet's De Havilland Q400 turboprops showed premature propeller failures.The airline alerted Dowty Propellers, a GE Aerospace-led UK manufacturer, which found damage to the internal bearings of the propellers.Each propeller has bearings with two races, or rings or tracks.In this case, the inner race was damaged.Instead of addressing the root cause, SpiceJet ""reportedly kept applying more grease to the [entire] unit instead of addressing the root cause.""If you look at global safety metrics, such as those published by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which track the number of accidents per million flights, India consistently performs better than the world average.Mr Kidwai told the BBC that the regulator had now ""refined"" its guidelines for pilots flying in turbulent conditions.The latest involved SpiceJet, India's fourth-largest and longest-running low-cost airline.",Negative

"After Diddy: Why hip-hop is still struggling to have its own 'MeToo' moment The Combs verdict in itself is unlikely to lead to wider changes in the industry, according to insiders",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yllvjgpk6o,"– Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was in the kitchen of his Beverly Hills estate with his assistant Capricorn Clark.Turning to her, he issued a string of commands: ""Sit down, stand up, turn around, walk over there, hand me that. Now go back."" His girlfriend obeyed his every word.""Did you see that?"" said Combs to his assistant. ""You won't do that. That's why you don't have a man like me.""This account, shared by Ms Clark (also known as Cassie) in her testimony during Combs' recent eight-week trial, gave a glimpse into his dynamic with his partner - and a sense of what was happening behind closed doors.Ms Ventura, an R&B singer who was previously signed to his record label, testified that throughout their long-term relationship, Combs—who was 17 years her senior—beat her, blackmailed her and coerced her into drug-fuelled sex sessions with escorts.Last week, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.But now, campaigners, survivors of sexual violence and insiders within the music industry are asking: Why did it take so long to hold Combs accountable?And, in light of Hollywood's MeToo movement that uncovered and helped root out sexual harassment and abuse in the film industry, and which began nearly a decade ago - is it now time that the music industry, or more specifically, hip-hop, had a MeToo movement of its own?",Negative
"Ex-Bangladesh leader authorised deadly crackdown, leaked audio suggests Sheikh Hasina authorised lethal force against protesters, according to leaked audio verified by the BBC.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4l1z5qd1vo,"– A deadly crackdown on student-led protests in Bangladesh last year was authorized by then prime minister Sheikh Hasina, according to audio of one of her phone calls verified by BBC Eye.In the audio, which was leaked online in March, Hasina says she authorized her security forces to ""use lethal weapons"" against protesters and that ""wherever they find [them], they will shoot.""Prosecutors in Bangladesh plan to use the recording as crucial evidence against Hasina, who is being tried in absentia at a special tribunal for crimes against humanity.Up to 1,400 people died in last summer's unrest, according to UN investigators.The leaked audio of Hasina's conversation with an unidentified senior government official is the most significant evidence yet that she gave direct authorisation to shoot anti-government protesters, tens of thousands of whom had taken to the streets by last summer.The protests began against civil service job quotas for relatives of those who fought in the 1971 war of independence and escalated into a mass movement that ousted Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years.The BBC investigation established previously unreported details about a police massacre of protesters in the capital—including a much higher death toll.",Negative
"Russian minister's death serves as warning to political elite President Putin sacked his transport minister. Hours later, his body was found in a park with a gunshot wound to the head.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l49310z2go,"– It was a dramatic start to the week in Russia.On Monday morning, President Vladimir Putin sacked his transport minister, Roman Starovoit.By the afternoon Starovoit was dead; his body was discovered in a park on the edge of Moscow with a gunshot wound to the head.Investigators said they presumed the former minister had taken his own life.In the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets this morning there was a sense of shock.""The suicide of Roman Starovoit just hours after the president's order to sack him is an almost unique occurrence in Russian history,"" the paper declared.Unlike before, when you could get these jobs, get rich, get promoted from regional level to federal level, today, that is clearly not a career path if you want to stay alive,"" says Nina Khrushcheva, professor of International Affairs at the New School in New York.""He must have feared that he would receive tens of years in prison if he was going to be under investigation, and that his family would suffer tremendously.So, there's no way out.I immediately thought of Sergo Ordzhonikidze, one of Stalin's ministers, who [killed himself] in 1937 because he felt there was no way out.Roman Starovoit's death may have made headlines in the papers here.But this ""almost unique occurrence in Russian history"" has received minimal coverage on state TV.Unlike before, when you could get these jobs, get these jobs, get rich, get promoted from regional level to federal level, today, that is clearly not a career path if you want to stay alive.",Negative
"Israeli defence minister plans to move Gaza's population to camp in Rafah Israel Katz tells Israeli media the so-called ""humanitarian city"" in Rafah will eventually house 2.1 million Palestinians.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rp31lk7mzo,"– Israel's defense minister says he has instructed its military to prepare a plan to move all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp in the south of the territory, Israeli media reports say.Israel Katz told journalists on Monday he wanted to establish a ""humanitarian city"" on the ruins of the city of Rafah to initially house about 600,000 Palestinians - and eventually the whole 2.1 million population.He said the goal was to bring people inside after security screening to ensure they were not Hamas operatives, and that they would not be allowed to leave.If conditions allowed, he added, construction would begin during a 60-day ceasefire that Israel and Hamas are trying to negotiate.One Israeli human rights lawyer condemned it as nothing less than an ""operational plan for a crime against humanity"".""It is all about population transfer to the southern tip of the Gaza Strip in preparation for deportation outside the strip,"" Michael Sfard told the Guardian newspaper.The UN has also previously warned that the deportation or forcible transfer of an occupied territory's civilian population is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing.""In March, Arab states backed a $53bn (£39bn) Egyptian alternative to Trump's plan for Gaza's reconstruction that would allow the Palestinians living there to stay in place.The Palestinian Authority and Hamas also endorsed the Egyptian plan, but the US and Israel said it failed to address realities in Gaza.",Negative
US airports lift shoe removal requirement at security screenings,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m8p3e93m8o,"– The shoe removal policy also followed the 11 September, 2001 terror attacks in the US when more than a dozen al-Qaeda terrorists armed with boxcutters and knives hijacked four commercial planes.The requirement for airline passengers to take off shoes for screenings had been in effect nationwide since 2006 after a British man hid a bomb in one of his shoes on a flight to Miami.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the change was in effect immediately for airports across the US, though a ""multi-layered"" screening process would remain in place.Before Noem made the announcement official on Tuesday evening, some airports - including Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport and Piedmont Triad International Airport in North Carolina - had already started implementing the new policy.The shoe removal rule was adopted after Richard Reid, a British man who became known as the ""shoe bomber"", was discovered to have explosives hidden in his footwear on a December 2001 flight from Paris to Miami.The homeland security secretary added: ""It's important we find ways to keep people safe, but also streamline and make the process much more enjoyable for every single person.""

Trump delays tariffs as the rest of the world plays hardball,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c628nk51364o,"– Donald Trump's White House had grandly promised ""90 deals in 90 days"" after partially pausing the process of levying what the US president called ""reciprocal"" tariffs.In reality, there won't even be nine deals done by the time we reach Trump's first cut-off date on 9 July. Financial markets believe in rolling delays, in the idea of TACO, that Trump Always Chickens Out - although they may embolden foot-dragging on all sides that lead to a renewed crisis.However, the real takeaway here has been the Trump administration's inability to strike deals.The jaunty letters being sent from the US to its trading partners this week are simply a reincarnation of that infamous White House ""Liberation Day"" blue board.The US may be playing hardball, but so are most other nations.Japan and South Korea were singled out for the first two letters, which effectively further blow up their trade deals with the US.The Japanese have done little to hide their fury at the US approach.Its finance minister even hinted at using its ownership of the world's biggest stockpile of US government debt - basically the biggest banker of America's debts - as a source of potential leverage.The dynamic from April has not really changed.",Negative
