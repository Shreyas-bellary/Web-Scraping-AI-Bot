'Chaos has gone' - quiet streets on Texas border after Trump crackdown Parts of El Paso that were once teeming with migrants now lay largely silent as border crossings hit a 50-year low.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn9jwqzy8o,"– When US President Donald Trump came into office in January—elected in part because of his promise to fix the border—the regular flow of migrants into El Paso slowed to a trickle.It is a trend that has repeated itself along the length of the 1,900-mile border, from the Pacific Coast in California to Texas' Gulf coast.The influx prompted El Paso's government to declare a state of emergency in late 2022 as local shelters ballooned beyond capacity.The reasons for the low figures—which began falling in Biden's last year in office and rapidly accelerated under Trump—are complex.Officials and experts point to a range of factors, including a Mexican crackdown on migrant flows north, the end of most humanitarian parole programs, much tighter asylum restrictions and increased surveillance with the help of the US military.Trump's deportation drive in the US interior has also served as a deterrent to would-be migrants.Demesio Guerrero, a naturalised US citizen originally from Mexico who lives in eastern Texas, described the border as ""chaos everywhere"" under the Biden administration.There are now only two.The relative trickle of migrants—15 to 20 in each location on a given night—is composed, in part, of those headed back home after years in the US.""We have people who entered and were given employment authorisation, or temporary protected status that Trump has taken away, and they can't renew their employment. Then they can't pay rent,"" Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia told the BBC.Others, he added, are simply in need of a place to stay while ""they can do the logistics"" of leaving the country.Trump's deportation drive in the US interior has also served as a deterrent to would-be migrants.",Positive
"Canada loses its measles-free status, with US on track to follow The country hasn't been able to curb an outbreak of more than 5,000 cases over the last year, while US cases are at a 33-year high.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e2lv4r8xo,"– Canada has lost its measles elimination status, said the Pan American Health Organization (Paho) on Monday, after failing to curb an outbreak of the virus for 12 consecutive months.Because Canada is no longer deemed measles-free, the Americas region as a whole has lost its elimination status, although individually the other countries are still considered to have stamped out the disease.The US, however, risks losing its status as well if it does not stop an ongoing outbreak by January.Canada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.At a news conference on Monday, Paho officials appealed to Canadian governments and the public to ramp up vaccinations, noting that 95% of the population needs to be immunized to stop the spread of measles.""This loss represents a setback, but it is also reversible,"" said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, the health organization's director.How Canada became the center of a measles outbreak in North AmericaMore than 150 children quarantined as US measles cases hit 33-year highThe Public Health Agency of Canada said in its own statement that it is collaborating with Paho and regional health authorities to improve vaccine rates and strengthen data sharing.Canada's outbreak began last October, with health officials attributing it to fewer people being vaccinated against measles.Canada's much smaller population.The bulk of the outbreak has been in ""under-vaccinated communities.""It highlights how many of our systems broke down to get us to this point,"" said Prof Bowdish of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.",Negative
