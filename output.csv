Trump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK borders,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd91wjypj9o,"– Donald Trump suggested Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer could use the military to stop illegal migration at a news conference marking the end of the US president's second state visit to the UK.Trump said he discussed migration issues with Sir Keir during a meeting at his country residence Chequers.The US president talked about his policies to secure borders in the US and said the UK faced a similar challenge with migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats.""You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use,"" Trump said. In a wide-ranging Q&A with UK and US journalists, the leaders were also asked about Palestinian statehood, free speech, the war in Ukraine, energy and other topics.The pair touted the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US, and announced a new tech deal Trump said would help the allies ""dominate"" in the world of artificial intelligence (AI).Trump also urged Western allies to stop buying Russian oil to force Putin to the negotiating table, but did not commit to sanctioning Moscow.Standing alongside Trump, the prime minister said illegal migration was an issue his government had been taking ""incredibly seriously.""Palestine does have some international recognition but has no agreed boundaries, no capital, and no army.Trump is opposed to such a move and accused Palestinian armed group Hamas of ""putting the hostages up as bait"" in Gaza.",Negative

I was in the process of getting my newspaper delivered to my home when a man came up to me on the street and said, ""Hi, I'm a BBC reporter and I'm writing a letter to the editor for the BBC."" I thought he was joking at the time, but now that he's actually written one, I can't help but notice that he's actually written a letter to the editor for the BBC as well.

"Doctor sexual misconduct hearings too lenient, review suggests",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4np1y8nvo,"– ""A significant proportion of our appeals are successful and result in stronger sanctions."" Tamzin Cuming and Prof Carrie Newlands from the Working Party on Sexual Misconduct in Surgery (WPSMS) said: ""Right now, the system gives little more than a slap on the wrist for abuse, when only erasure and accountability can ensure safety.""Without reform, powerful perpetrators will continue with impunity.""This new study, external by six independent academics, analysed 222 MPTS tribunal cases heard between August 2023 and August 2024.Of these cases, 46 involved proven sexual misconduct.All the doctors involved in the sexual misconduct cases were men, and almost all of them were consultants, GPs or registrars.Several cases involved multiple victims, which the researchers say demonstrates repeated and systemic abuse - some over a period of nine years.The General Medical Council said it takes ""a zero-tolerance and proactive approach"" to all forms of sexual misconduct.""Where we feel the sanctions applied by the independent tribunal are too lenient—we can, and do appeal.'",Positive
