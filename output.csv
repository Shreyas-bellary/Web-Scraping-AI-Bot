Fed Reserve cuts interest rates but cautions over stalling job market,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75y90pw0o,"– It's finally happening. After months of economic debate and mounting attacks from US President Donald Trump, the US central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve said it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points. That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25%—the lowest level since late 2022.The move—the bank's first rate cut since last December—is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US. But today's move carries a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates.At the Fed's last meeting, two members of the board even backed a cut.They were outvoted, as other members remained worried that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, tariffs and mass detentions of migrant workers, might cause inflation to flare back up again.At the news conference following the announcement, Powell emphasized that the unemployment rate remained low, at 4.3%, while acknowledging unusual disagreement among members about what to do next.Forecasts released by the Fed suggest the central bank could lower interest rates by an additional 0.5 percentage points this year.",Negative
