Canada follows France and UK with plan to recognise Palestinian state Mark Carney says the move depends on Palestinian democratic reforms and elections without Hamas.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqyx35d9x2o,"– Most countries - 147 of the UN's 193 member states - formally recognize a Palestinian state. Most countries - 147 of the UN's 193 member states - formally recognize a Palestinian state. Prime Minister Mark Carney has said Canada plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, becoming the third G7 nation to make such an announcement in recent days.Carney said the move depends on democratic reforms, including the Palestinian Authority holding elections next year without Hamas.He said a recognition of Palestinian statehood would hinge on commitments by the Palestinian Authority to fundamentally reform its governance and to demilitarise the territory.Canada had long been committed to a two-state solution as part of a negotiated peace process, Carney said, but he added ""this approach is no longer tenable"".""The prospect of a Palestinian state is being eroded before our eyes,"" he said.Carney told the news conference he had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas earlier on Wednesday about the announcement.Asked whether he was influenced by the UK and France's announcements, or whether he had consulted US President Donald Trump, Carney responded that Canada made its own foreign policy decisions.If France and the UK do formally recognize Palestinian statehood, the US - a strong ally of Israel - will be the only permanent member of the UN Security Council not to do so.",Positive
Trump announces deal to impose 15% tariff on South Korea The agreement comes just a day before a 1 August deadline for countries to strike deals with the US.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpvl9krxwo,"– President Trump says the US will charge a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, in what he called a ""full and complete trade deal."" It comes just a day before a 1 August deadline for countries to reach agreements with the US or be hit with higher tariffs. South Korea had been facing a 25% levy if it had not struck a deal.Pressure on Seoul had been mounting after Japan, a key competitor in the car and manufacturing industries, secured a 15% tariff rate with the US this week.The deal, which will also see Seoul invest $350bn (£264.1bn) in the US, has been touted as a success in South Korea - especially given the record trade surplus of at least $56bn with the US last year.The 15% tariff rate will cover both cars and semiconductors, two of Seoul's main exports to the US last year.This deal also does not touch South Korea's military alliance with the US and the billions of dollars Washington spends to help defend the South from North Korea.The deal, which will also see Seoul invest $350bn (£264.1bn) in the US, has been touted as a success in South Korea - especially given the record trade surplus of at least $56bn with the US last year.",Positive
Why Australians celebrate Christmas twice a year The Australian tradition was born in the 1980s after a group of Irishmen became homesick for a winter Christmas.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crevj4nn34yo,"– It's hard to pinpoint exactly when and where Christmas in July began—there are some rumors the US actually pioneered it in the early 20th Century—but Garry Crockett believes Australia's national tradition began in his Mountain Heritage hotel in 1980.One cold July evening, with snow falling outside, half a dozen Irishmen walked into the Katoomba huts, nostalgic for a traditional winter Christmas.""So I told them, why don't we do a Christmas in July for you?"" Mr Crockett, now 76, tells the BBC.A Christmas tree was off, tinsel and baubles were unpacked, and the hotel was decked out with decorations.While this month is mid-summer for half the world, Australia is in the depths of winter and for many, that means it's time for tinsel, turkey, and Yuletide tunes.From then on, Christmas in July became an annual gathering at the Mountain Heritage.It's hard to pinpoint exactly when and where Christmas in July began—there are some rumors the US actually pioneered it in the early 20th Century—but Garry Crockett believes Australia's national tradition began in his Mountain Heritage hotel in 1980.One cold July evening, with snow falling outside, half a dozen Irishmen walked into the Katoomba huts, nostalgic for a traditional winter Christmas.""So I told them, why don't we do a Christmas in July for you?""

"US allies break with Trump to force diplomatic shift on Gaza As Canada joins France and the UK with plans to recognise a Palestinian state, the US stands firmly with Israel - but does Trump have a long-term plan for Gaza's future?",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6rl6158no,"– The US is standing firmly with Israel—but does Trump have a long-term plan for Gaza's future?Of all history's declarations about the Middle East, one that may be less prominent in the global collective memory was in Tokyo in November 2023.Then-US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken laid out a series of principles for the ""day after"" the war in Gaza at a meeting of the G7 a group of the world's most powerful countries.He traveled there from Tel Aviv, after meeting Israel's leadership a month after the Hamas attacks on October 7, during the ensuing Israeli offensive on Gaza.Blinken listed what amounted to US conditions for Israel's military objectives and the wider conflict: No forcible displacement of Palestinians.No Israeli re-occupation of Gaza after the war ends.No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza.It amounts to a growing evidence that the Trump administration's strategy on Gaza increasingly parallels that of its Israeli ally.In February, President Trump declared that the US would take over the Gaza Strip and build a ""riviera of the Middle East"" in a plan that involved the forced displacement of Palestinians in the territory, which the US and Israel later tried to claim meant ""voluntary"" emigration.Asked on Tuesday about his plan to move Palestinians Trump described it as ""a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people, but also some people didn't like it.""The administration prefers to talk about the immediate issue: freeing hostages and getting a ceasefire.",Negative
"Why did Russian mega earthquake not cause more tsunami damage? The earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded, but its tsunami was not as bad as feared.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l6pj7kjg7o,"– It has been one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded—but so far has not brought the catastrophic tsunami that many feared.When the 8.8-magnitude quake struck eastern Russia at 11:25 local time on Wednesday (00:25 BST), it raised concerns for coastal populations across the Pacific.Millions of people were evacuated, as minds cast back to the devastating tsunami of Boxing Day 2004 in the Indian Ocean and Japan 2011, both triggered by similarly large earthquakes.But today's tsunami has been much less severe, even though it's brought some damage.So what caused the earthquake and tsunami—and why wasn't it as bad as initially feared? The Kamchatka Peninsula is remote but lies in the ""Pacific Ring of Fire""—so called because of the high number of earthquakes and volcanoes that occur here.The upper layers of the Earth are split into sections— tectonic plates—which are all moving relative to one another.The ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" is an arc of these plates that extends around the Pacific.The largest earthquakes recorded in history, including the three strongest in Chile, Alaska and Sumatra, were all megathrust earthquakes.The Pacific plate is oceanic, which means it has dense rocks and wants to sink beneath the less dense microplate.As the Pacific plate sinks towards the center of the Earth, it heats up and begins to melt, effectively disappearing.""When we typically think about earthquakes, we imagine an epicentre as a small point on a map.However, for such large earthquakes, the fault will have ruptured over many hundreds of kilometers,"" explained Dr Stephen Hicks, lecturer in environmental seismology at University College London.""It is this vast amount of slip and area of the fault that generates such a high earthquake magnitude.""The largest earthquakes recorded in history, including the three strongest in Chile, Alaska and Sumatra, both triggered by similarly large earthquakes.",Negative
