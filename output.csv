"Trump criticises 'decaying' European countries and 'weak' leaders The UK praises Europe's ""strength"" after Trump says countries fail to control migration or take action to end the Ukraine war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydlwldkvko,"– In a wide-ranging interview with Politico, he said ""decaying"" European countries had failed to control migration or take decisive action to end Ukraine's war with Russia, accusing them of letting Kyiv fight ""until they drop."" Asked whether Europe could help end the war, Trump said: ""They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on."" US officials have held separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent weeks in an attempt to broker an end to the war.So far, no agreement has been reached.Ukraine's president has pressed European and NATO leaders to help deter the US from backing a deal that Kyiv fears would leave it exposed to future attacks.Trump continued to increase pressure on Zelensky to agree to a peace deal, and urged him to ""play ball"" by ceding territory to Moscow. Asked whether leaders who he viewed as weak could still be allies, he replied: ""It depends"", adding: ""I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct.The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe ""will not be viable countries any longer"" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: ""What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.""",Negative
Canadian senator presses Ottawa on only land disputed between the US and Canada An American tour group saying the uninhabited Machias Seal Island is “on the Maine Coast” has upset one Canadian senator.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8e2kxp3m7o,"– An uninhabited island at the center of a century-old Canada–US territorial dispute is back in the spotlight after a Canadian senator urged Ottawa to assert sovereignty over the piece of land.Senator Jim Quinn from New Brunswick has taken issue with an American boat tour group that describes Machias Seal Island on its website as being ""on the Maine Coast.""He has called on Ottawa to review its permitting of the tour group to visit the island—home to thousands of puffins—as well as the mention of the group on a government website.Machias Seal Island is a tiny, rugged island located in a disputed ""Grey Zone"" between the US state of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick.The Canadian government lists two tour groups that are permitted to visit the island—Canadian company SeaWatch Tours, and the US-based Bold Coast Charter Company.Senator Quinn asked Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which he says is the administrator of the land, why it issues a permit to an American company ""that actively describes Machias Seal Island as part of the state of Maine.""It is because of these comments that Senator Quinn believes Canada should assert its sovereignty over Machias Seal Island and ask that Bold Coast recognize it.The island is the only land disputed by Canada and the US, though an international court ruling in 1984 gave both countries the right to fish in its waterway.Both Americans and Canadians have operated on and around the island since, though the US has long accused Canada of unfair trade action in the local lobster fishery.",Negative

How long Britain could really fight for if war broke out tomorrow,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq5zdv907o,"– Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article ""We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now."" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by NATO allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and NATO countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped. Analysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass casualties. At a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organized by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.""There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,"" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell.",Negative
