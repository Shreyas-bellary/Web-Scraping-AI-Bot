The police said the women and young girls we filmed could not be traced.There are no recent statistics on the number of children forced to work in Kenya's sex industry.Prostitution is a cash crop in Maai Mahiu; the truckers basically fuel it.The trafficking or sale of minors under the age of 18 carries a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life.When asked whether the clients wear condoms, Nyambura said she usually made sure they had protection but the odd one did not.""Some children want to earn more [so don't use them],"" she said.

Democrats flee Texas to block Republican redistricting map backed by Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz601p6jv8vo,"– Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas in a bid to stop a vote on a new congressional map that would heavily favor Republicans.The redistricting, unveiled by Texas' majority Republicans last week and backed by President Donald Trump, would create five new Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.Two-thirds of the 150-member Texas legislature must be present in order to hold a vote. Fifty-one Democratic lawmakers have fled, most of them to Illinois, denying Republicans the required quorum.They said they plan to stay away for two weeks until the end of a special legislative session convened by Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott.The session is being held to approve the redistricting, as well as provide disaster relief for last month's deadly Texas floods and to ban THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.Each of the 51 lawmakers could face a $500 fine for every day they are away, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, has threatened to have them arrested.Texas Republicans currently hold 25 out of 38 congressional seats in the Lone Star State.They hope the new maps could increase that number to 30 - all in constituencies that Trump won last November by at least 10 points.This is the third time in the past few years that Democrats have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum.Texas Democrats also left for Oklahoma in 2003 in a bid to stop redistricting that Republicans eventually managed to get approved.States typically undergo redistricting every 10 years, when voting maps are redrawn to account for population changes.",Positive
