Republicans are pushing to pass a bill funding the government without other initiatives attached—known as a clean CR or continuing resolution. But they only have 53 seats in the Senate and need 60 votes to pass such a bill. Therefore, they need Democrats. Democrats, meanwhile, believe their push for preserving health insurance subsidies is a popular one.

Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time US scientists testing the technique say it could help people overcome infertility and potentially allow same-sex couples to have a genetically related child.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2vyee0zlo,"– US scientists have, for the first time, made early-stage human embryos by manipulating DNA taken from people's skin cells and then fertilizing it with sperm.The technique could overcome infertility due to old age or disease, by using almost any cell in the body as the starting point for life.It could even allow same-sex couples to have a genetically related child.The method requires significant refinement—which could take a decade—before a fertility clinic could even consider using it.Experts said it was an impressive breakthrough, but there needed to be an open discussion with the public about what science was making possible.In addition to offering hope for millions of people with infertility due to lack of eggs or sperm, this method would allow for the possibility of same-sex couples to have a child genetically related to both partners.""We achieved something that was thought to be impossible,"" said Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the director of the Oregon Health and Science University's center for embryonic cell and gene therapy.The technique is far from polished as the egg randomly chooses which chromosomes to discard.It needs to end up with one of each of the 23 types to prevent disease, but ends up with two of some and none of others.Prof Mitalipov, a world-renowned pioneer in the field, told me: ""We have to perfect it.""Eventually, I think that's where the future will go because there are more and more patients that cannot have children.""",Positive
