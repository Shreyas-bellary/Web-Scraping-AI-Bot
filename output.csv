"In the AI gold rush, tech firms are embracing 72-hour weeks In the race for AI, tech firms are asking for their staff to work long hours. But there are risks, experts say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn2k285ypo,"– If you're not excited about... working 70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC."" The website belongs to Rilla, a New York-based tech business which sells AI-based systems that allow employers to monitor sales representatives when they are out and about, interacting with clients. The company has become something of a poster child for a fast-paced workplace culture known as 996, also sometimes referred to as hustle culture or grindcore. In simple terms, it puts a premium on long working hours, typically 9am to 9pm, six days a week (hence ""996""). But according to Will Gao, head of growth at Rilla, its 120 employees simply don't see it that way. The 996 culture first came to the fore in China a decade ago. It was embraced by tech companies and start-ups at a time when the country was increasingly focused on transforming itself from the world's workshop for cheap goods into a leader in advanced technologies. But such an attitude prompted a backlash, including a wave of online complaints that companies were ignoring labor laws and failing to pay overtime, while forcing employees to work excessive hours. So why has the US tech industry chosen to embrace the trend? A key factor appears to have been the headlong rush to develop ways of using AI.",Positive
"Iranian Nobel laureate handed further prison sentence, lawyer says Narges Mohammadi was arrested in December for making ""provocative remarks"" at a memorial, where she was also reportedly beaten.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygw161wzvo,"– Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi has been handed further prison sentences of seven-and-a-half years by an Iranian court, her lawyer has said. The human rights activist was sentenced to six years for ""gathering and collusion"", and one-and-a-half years for ""propaganda activities"" by a court in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, Mostafa Nili announced on social media on Sunday. Mohammadi was arrested in December for making ""provocative remarks"" at a memorial ceremony, Iranian authorities said at the time. The 53-year-old was made a Nobel laureate in 2023 for activism against the oppression of women in Iran. Nili, who spoke to Mohammadi for the first time since 14 December, said she had also been handed a two-year ban on leaving the country and two years of exile to the eastern Khusf region. The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.",Negative
Thai PM claims election victory with conservatives well ahead of rivals The ruling conservatives defied opinion polls predicting a win for the reformist People's Party.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jn4z4eq0o,"– Prime Minister Anutin Charnavirakul has claimed victory in Thailand's general election, with preliminary vote counts putting his ruling conservatives well ahead of their rivals. Anutin said his success belonged to ""all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not."" With 90% of the votes counted, Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is projected to win 194 seats in Bangkok's 500-seat parliament, with the People's Party in second place on 116. The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted. The election was called in December after the coalition led by Anutin collapsed after just three months. While no party is projected to gain an overall majority, Anutin is now almost certain to stay in office, with his Bhumjaithai likely to have more than double the number of seats it won in the last election in 2023. The party, which under a different name Move Forward won the election in 2023, but was blocked from taking power by the unelected senate, found itself pushed into second place this time by Anutin's pragmatic conservatives.",Positive
'Trump's psyche': The aide driving president's most controversial policies The high-velocity start to 2026 by the Trump administration has cemented Stephen Miller's position as one of its most powerful figures.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8rl71n4r3o,"– ""It wasn't enough for Stephen Miller that these American citizens were murdered by ICE and CBP, he had to slander them with lies after their deaths,"" Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia wrote in a post on social media website Bluesky. Miller is a deranged, bloodthirsty bigot, and his policies put lives at risk every day he remains in power."" In May, it was Miller who demanded that immigration enforcement officials do more to detain and deport undocumented migrants in American cities. He told Fox News the administration had set a target of 3,000 arrests a day - a figure that dwarfed previous numbers. Miller stuck by the president in his darkest days, following the 2020 election defeat, the attack by his supporters on the US Capitol and his political exile from Washington. ""Stephen Miller is the architect of this mass deportation policy, said Bryan Lanza, a conservative strategist who worked on Trump's 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns. Miller has denied being animated by racism or bigotry.",Negative

UK PM Starmer's chief aide quits over Mandelson row,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8r1xp7j533o,"– Morgan McSweeney has dramatically quit as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The PM's adviser had been coming under pressure after pushing for the former minister to be given the job, despite the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein being publicly known about at the time. McSweeney said he did not oversee the vetting but wanted to take ""full responsibility"" for advising the prime minister to appoint him. It leaves Sir Keir battling to shore up his premiership as he continues to face anger from Labour MPs over his decision to hire the peer for the Washington role. It comes as the boss of the Fire Brigades Union, Steve Wright, became the first leader of one of Labour's 11 affiliated unions to call for the prime minister to go. McSweeney's departure is a big blow to Sir Keir, with the 48-year-old Irishman having masterminded his successful bid for the Labour leadership in 2020 and the party's campaign for the general election in 2024.",Negative
Christchurch shooter seeks to overturn guilty plea,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vevxnw9pko,"– Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques will appear in court this week to try to withdraw his guilty plea. Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch. He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack. The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of ""torturous and inhumane"" conditions in prison. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link. At the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have ""no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again.""",Negative
