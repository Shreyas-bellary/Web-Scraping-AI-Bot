Trump says he did not want 'wasted meeting' after plan for Putin talks shelved The comments by the US president come after plans to meet his Russian counterpart over the war in Ukraine were put on hold.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjp73gp41o,"– Donald Trump has said he did not want a ""wasted meeting"" after a plan to have face-to-face talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine were put on hold.The US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line, in remarks at the White House on Tuesday.Earlier, a White House official had said there were ""no plans"" for a Trump-Putin meeting ""in the immediate future"", after Trump said on Thursday that the two would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks.Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organized summit which yielded no concrete results.The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may be seen as an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.""I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,"" a senior European diplomat told Reuters.A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week—but the White House said the two had had a ""productive"" call and that a meeting was no longer ""necessary.""Trump had discussed a summit in the Hungarian capital over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.Some reports suggested those talks had been a ""shouting match"", with sources suggesting Trump had pushed Zelensky to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.",Negative
"Why Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can't with Putin over Ukraine The leaders' cancelled summit is just the latest twist in Trump's efforts to broker an end to the war, writes Anthony Zurcher.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y9je4d3go,"– The US president, in fact, is more popular among Israelis than Netanyahu—a position that gave him unique influence over the Israeli leader.Meanwhile, the president has publicly berated Zelensky, temporarily cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and suspending arms shipments to the country—only to then back off in the face of concerned European allies who warn a Ukrainian collapse could destabilise the entire region.Trump loves to tout his ability to sit down and hammer out deals, but his face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky haven't seemed to move the war any closer to a resolution.The on-again, off-again summit is just the latest twist in Trump's efforts to broker an end to war in Ukraine—a subject of renewed focus for the US president after he arranged a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.",Negative

Albanese praised Rudd's work as ambassador at a Friends of Australia breakfast attended by US politicians.If there's a harder working ambassador on The Hill, then please let me know, because Kevin works his guts out and he seems to know everyone,"" he told Republican and Democratic members of Congress at the event.Rudd, a former Australian Prime Minister, was appointed as ambassador in 2023 for a four-year posting, which is due to end in March 2027.In 2020, he wrote that Trump was the ""most destructive president in history"" and a ""traitor to the West.""",Positive
ChatGPT-maker OpenAI releases browser in attempt to rival Google ChatGPT Atlas was unveiled as the company seeks new ways to corral users to its online offerings,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07mz10m1k9o,"– ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has unveiled an artificial intelligence-powered web browser to challenge competitors like Google, which operates Chrome, the most popular browser in the world.ChatGPT boss Sam Altman said it was ""built around ChatGPT"" as the company made the new browser available on Tuesday on Apple's operating system.The arrival of Atlas comes as OpenAI seeks new ways to monetize its massive bet on artificial intelligence (AI) and capitalize on its growing user base.OpenAI said Atlas would also offer a paid agent mode that conducts searches on its own for users of its popular chatbot.I believe that early adopters will kick the tires on the new OpenAI browser,"" said Pat Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.But, he said, he was skeptical that Atlas would pose a serious challenge to Chrome or Microsoft Edge ""as more mainstream, beginners, and corporate users will just wait for their favorite browsers to offer this capability.""OpenAI's challenge comes a year after Google was declared an illegal monopolist in online search.In a recent decision aimed at prescribing remedies for Google's dominance, the search giant was not ordered to spin off its Chrome browser as US Justice Department lawyers had requested.A growing number of internet users are opting to use large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as they search for answers and recommendations.The research firm Datos said that as of July, 5.99% of search on desktop browsers went to LLMs—more than double the figure from a year earlier.",Positive
"Who is paying for Trump's White House ballroom? A former White House chief ethics lawyer described the ballroom donations as an ethical ""nightmare"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891yxgj44ko,"– Groundbreaking for the ornate 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) project began on Monday, with excavators and construction workers tearing out portions of the East Wing. The US president has said that he personally will pay for significant portions of its construction, and suggested that some still anonymous donors would be willing to spend more than $20m to complete the project.The funding model has sparked concern among some legal experts, who say it may amount to paying for access to the administration.At the event for potential donors, Trump said many of the attendees had been ""really, really generous"" and said that some had asked whether $25m was an appropriate donation.The White House has insisted there was nothing inappropriate about soliciting donations and that the ballroom will be used by future administrations.But Mr Painter suggested it could be considered a ""pay-to-play scheme"", which has dogged previous White House administrations of both political parties.In the 1990s, for example, then-President Bill Clinton came under scrutiny for allegedly selling overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for campaign contributions.",Positive
