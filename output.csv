Child sex abuse victim begs Elon Musk to remove links to her images BBC investigation finds US victim's images are traded globally by an operator based in Indonesia.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq587wv4d5go,"– A victim of child sexual abuse has begged Elon Musk to stop links offering images of her abuse being posted on his social media platform X.""Hearing that my abuse—and the abuse of so many others—is still being circulated and commodified here is infuriating,"" says Zora (not her real name) who lives in the United States and was first abused more than 20 years ago.""My body is not a commodity. It never has been, and it never will be,"" she says.""Those who distribute this material are not passive bystanders, they are complicit perpetrators.""

Man finds wife's lost wedding rings after searching through landfill A Canadian husband crawled on his hands and knees through piles of compost to find the diamond rings.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewyr1jl9jko,"– A Canadian man dug through piles of rubbish at his local dump in a valiant, romantic - and ultimately successful - effort to find his wife's accidentally discarded wedding rings.The story begins when Steve Van Ysseldyk and his wife of 26 years, Jeannine, brought home a bag of popcorn from the cinema and spilled it in their garden.While gathering up the buttery mess, Mrs Van Ysseldyk's rings seemingly fell into the popcorn bag which was then thrown into a compost bin.The couple only realized the rings were missing after the compost had been collected.So, the next day, Mr Van Ysseldyk traveled to the dump to begin the daunting task of searching through 18 tons of organic waste.

Trump orders removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook The US president posts a letter addressed to Cook in which he informed her of his decision.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx275n8gx0ro,"– President Trump has said he will immediately remove Federal Reserve official Lisa Cook from her position, a major escalation in his battle against the US central bank.In an announcement made on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump posted a letter addressed to Cook in which he informed her of his decision to remove her from the bank's board of governors with immediate effect.He said there was ""sufficient reason"" to believe she had made false statements on mortgage agreements, and cited his powers under the constitution to remove the senior official.Neither Cook or the Federal Reserve has commented on the sacking, which the president announced late on Monday. Trump has put increasing pressure on the Fed - especially its chair Jerome Powell - in recent weeks over what he sees as the central bank's unwillingness to lower interest rates. It is also likely to raise legal questions, with experts suggesting the White House will need to demonstrate - potentially in court - that it had sufficient reason to fire her.According to Trump's letter, Cook signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be her primary residence for the next year.Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year.""It is inconceivable that you were not aware of your first commitment when making the second,"" he wrote.",Positive
