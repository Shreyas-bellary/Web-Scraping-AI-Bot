"Rubio says US will 'blow up' foreign crime groups if needed The secretary of state made the comments during a trip to Ecuador, where he announced new measures targeting criminal gangs.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx23nzwjnwwo,"– Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US will ""blow up"" foreign crime groups if needed, possibly in collaboration with other countries.""Now they're gonna help us find these people and blow them up, if that's what it takes,"" Rubio said during a visit to Ecuador. The comments come days after US forces carried out a strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea. The White House says it killed 11 drug-traffickers, though it did not release their identities. Asked whether smugglers coming from US allies, like Mexico and Ecuador, could face ""unilateral execution"" from US forces, Rubio said ""co-operative governments"" would help identify smugglers.""The president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they've been waging war on us for 30 years and no-one has responded.""But there's no need to do that in many cases with the friendly governments, because the friendly governments are going to help us.""The Ecuadorian and Mexican governments have not said they would assist with military strikes.This designation was desired by the Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who described his clampdown on criminal gangs as a ""war."" In an interview with the BBC earlier this year, he said he would be ""glad"" if the US considered Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as terrorist groups because ""that's what they really are.""",Negative

Trump's tariffs are pushing food and drink exporters closer to China Agricultural brokers tell the BBC there has been a surge of interest from exporters in trade with China.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzrqd4pdjo,"– China has now become ""a shining light"" for Brazil's coffee exporters, thanks to its growing cafe culture and enormous market, supply chain specialist Hugo Portes told the BBC.""If the tariffs are meant to weaken Brazil, in reality, it is pushing sellers closer to China,"" said Mr Portes, who trades raw coffee beans around the world.""But for US coffee roasters, a five-pound (2.268kg) bag of Brazilian beans could rise by about 25% in the coming months, according to coffee consultant Luke Waite.The jump means coffee drinkers might end up paying up to 7% more per cup, assuming cafes absorb some of the extra cost, he estimated.""It seems small, but these costs add up day-to-day."" In India, where a 50% US tariff took effect in August, exporters of goods like tea and seafood are also looking to China.The South Asian nation has been caught up in Washington's push to pressure Russia over the Ukraine War.",Negative
"'Alligator Alcatraz' immigration centre can stay open, appeals court rules Florida Governor Ron DeSantis welcomes the ruling and declares the Everglades site ""open for business"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl5ry3rgzro,"– The Department of Homeland Security had begun transferring detainees out of the Everglades, a Unesco World Heritage Site, late last month in compliance with that court order. But on Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit concluded that state and federal officials would probably succeed in showing the facility was not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act because it had not yet received any federal funding.The virtually abandoned Florida airport in the sensitive wetlands was transformed into a detention center in July.The homeland security department said the appellate ruling was a ""win for the American people, the rule of law and common sense"".""This lawsuit was never about the environmental impacts of turning a developed airport into a detention facility,"" the department wrote in a post on X.""It has and will always be about open-borders activists and judges trying to keep law enforcement from removing dangerous criminal aliens from our communities, full stop,"" DeSantis said.A lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said the decision was ""a heartbreaking blow to America's Everglades and every living creature there, but the case isn't even close to over.""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business,"" said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.",Negative
"Trump to rebrand Pentagon as Department of War The US president has sought to refocus the department on ""warfighting"" and a ""warrior ethos"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr9r4qr0ppo,"– President Trump is directing that the Department of Defense be known as the Department of War.He will sign an executive order on Friday for the defense department to use the new name as a secondary title and for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to be known as Secretary of War.The Pentagon - which oversees the US armed services - is the successor to the War Department, which was first established as a cabinet-level agency in 1789 and existed until 1947.The responsibility of creating executive departments rests with the US Congress, meaning that an amendment would be required to legally change the department's name. The BBC has seen the text of the executive order, which says: ""The name 'Department of War' conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve compared to 'Department of Defense,' which emphasizes only defensive capabilities.""In an effort to ""project strength and resolve,"" the order authorises the defense secretary, his department and subordinate officials to use the new titles as secondary names.The order also instructs the Hegseth to recommend and include legislative and executive actions to move toward a permanent renaming of the department since Trump cannot formally change the name without congressional approval.The Department of War was established by George Washington but was rebranded following World War II. According to the executive order, restoring its name ""will sharpen the focus of this Department on our national interest and signal to adversaries America's readiness to wage war to secure its interests.""The White House is yet to say how much a permanent rebrand would cost, but US media expects a billion-dollar price tag for the overhaul of hundreds of agencies, emblems, email addresses, uniforms, and more, possibly hampering the Pentagon's efforts to cut spending and waste. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of the name change, arguing that the US had ""an unbelievable history of victory"" in both world wars under the previous name.",Negative
Melania Trump warns 'robots are here' in rare public outing The first lady has taken a different - and selective - approach to her duties in the White House.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn82lp7y3pro,"– First Lady Melania Trump made a rare public appearance at the White House on Thursday, telling the crowd that ""the robots are here"" and that it is ""our responsibility to prepare America's children"" for the AI-driven decades ahead.The event—a meeting of a White House AI education task force established earlier this year—was one of so far only a handful of public events for a first lady who has proven both elusive and influential since her husband returned to the White House.Born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia, the 55-year-old first lady and former fashion model was, for a time, often described as an ""enigma""—less public than her predecessors, with fewer speeches and public engagements. Einav Rabinovitch-Fox, a professor at Case Western Reserve University and historian who focuses on first ladies, told the BBC that while ""it's not unusual"" for those in the role to focus on young people, Mrs Trump has taken a different tack. Anita McBride, the director of American University's First Ladies Initiative—and one-time chief of staff to former First Lady Laura Bush—said that such events demonstrate a key change for Mrs Trump when compared to her first term.Mrs Trump's letter was not without precedent, and other first ladies have also taken a role in helping shape US foreign policy.",Positive

During three hours of testimony, Democrats accused the US health secretary of lying and restricting Americans' access to vaccines. The hearing comes a week after Kennedy fired the leader of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a clash over his vaccine policies.Kennedy said he did not know because of ""data chaos"" under the Biden administration.He described the overhaul at the agency—which included the resignations of several top officials—as ""absolutely necessary"" and that it had ""failed miserably during Covid.""The toughest Republican questioning came from Senator Bill Cassidy, a doctor who has said he voted to confirm Kennedy only after he assured him he would uphold several US vaccine policies.Kennedy's hearing comes a week after he fired 600 CDC employees in addition to Monarez.Under Kennedy's leadership, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a round of Covid-19 immunisations, only for adults 65 and older and people with medical conditions.""You're wrong,"" Kennedy responded.",Negative

How style icon Giorgio Armani revolutionised fashion,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c90z02n04nwo,"– Giorgio Armani, who has died at the age of 91, was the first designer since Coco Chanel to bring about a lasting change in the way people dress.Born in a pre-war era of rigid traditions and styles, his creations followed—and helped make possible—increasing social fluidity in the latter half of the 20th Century.Chiefly, he will be remembered for reinventing the suit— feminising it for men and popularizing it for women.Armani took away the restrictions and confinements of stiffer styles that went before him—making men feel sophisticated and women empowered in the workplace.His family's comfortable middle-class lifestyle was destroyed by the war and, with food hard to find, his earliest memory was hunger.Armani played with unexploded artillery shells in the street, until one suddenly went off.He went on to dress stars on the Oscar night red carpet, and design costumes for dozens of film and television shows: notably The Untouchables and 1980s crime series Miami Vice.With Armani's tailored power suits, women were offered an alternative to the stiff and stuffy their mothers had worn to work.They exuded femininity, but were a powerful statement of equality.In 1978, the company signed an agreement with clothes manufacturer GFT—which gave it the ability to produce luxury ready-to-wear clothes in volume.At the same time, Armani pulled off a huge marketing coup.He won a contract to dress Richard Gere in American Gigolo.",Positive
