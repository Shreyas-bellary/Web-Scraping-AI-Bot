"My trip to North Korea's 'Benidorm' - flanked by guards and full of rules Anastasia, one of the first Russian visitors to North Korea's new resort, tells of ""immaculate"" beaches, meaty meals and strict rules.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c707d1ez0kno,"– It was the security guards accompanying Anastasia Samsonova's group that suggested this wasn't a typical beach holiday.In July, the 33-year-old human resources worker was one of the first tourists to stay at a new holiday resort in North Korea, a country largely closed to the outside world.Set in an exclusive area on the east coast where leader Kim Jong Un spent much of his youth, the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone opened on 1 July.Built near a missile testing site, the resort features hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and a water park, according to state media.But while it was initially billed as being open to international tourists, so far only Russians, entering in groups and organized by accredited travel agencies, have been allowed in. Anastasia says her group was also told not to photograph construction sites and was expected not to wear revealing clothes.She says the guides told her the guards were needed to ""prevent situations where we interacted with locals and startled them.""When we walked down the street, they [North Koreans] looked at us with great surprise because the country has been closed for a very long time,"" says Anastasia.Anastasia says no missiles were launched while she was there, but toy rockets were being sold nearby for $40.The travel agency which organized the first three trips to the resort, Vostok Intur, said there was high interest in potential tours in September, but North Korean authorities had yet to agree to them.Initially, tours were advertised online by Russian travel agencies for mid-September, but these were later removed.It is not just Russians who face difficulties getting to Wonsan Kalma, according to Andrei Lankov, an expert in China, an expert at Kookmin University in Seoul.He says Pyongyang deliberately limits the number of tourists and economic partner to only Russian citizens.Anastasia describes the resort as ""very raw"" and ""not the kind of vacation Russian tourists are used to.""But if you're tired of Asia, Turkey, Turkey, etc.Another tourist, and want something exotic—this is it,"" she added.",Positive
"National flags have started lining English streets - and it may say something more With St George's and union jack flags appearing on many lampposts, we visit the epicentre of the phenomenon to find out why.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx271162ee3o,"– Driving through the south west of Birmingham, it's hard not to notice something about the lampposts.For more than a mile, almost every one has a St George's or union jack flag attached—thousands of them.In one district, Weoley Castle, the BBC found two men carrying a ladder and shopping bags.In the cafe, we're told the first flags were put up in Weoley Castle's square in response to a story in the nearby town of Rugby about a 12-year-old girl who was prevented from making a speech about being British in her school, while wearing a union jack-themed dress.It's rare to see national flags lining our streets like this in Great Britain, beyond special occasions like royal, sporting or military events, so why are they appearing now—and does this say something bigger about people's perceptions of modern-day Britain?""",Positive

Maxwell is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials. Shortly after the interview with Blanche—who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney—she was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a sex-trafficking scheme, and has petitioned the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.The White House has been adamant that ""no leniency is being given or discussed"" in Maxwell's case.",Negative

UK opposition leaders - and some Chagossians now resident in the UK - have criticized the deal.The agreement was welcomed by Mauritian Attorney General Gavin Glover who told the BBC in May: ""Our country is that this 60-year struggle is finally over."" However two women born in Diego Garcia who wanted to be able to return there had raised a last-minute legal challenge to the deal in May.The treaty will come into effect only after it is approved by both the UK and Mauritian parliaments.The prime minister insisted that the deal was imperative to maintaining the UK's national security.The islands were then cleared to make way for a UK-US armed forces base with large groups of Chagossians moving to Mauritius and the Seychelles, or taking up an invitation to settle in England, mainly in Crawley, West Sussex.The pope said he hoped Mauritian authorities would ensure the refugees are able to return home.",Positive

National Guard in Washington DC to be armed amid crime crackdown,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7yperjxneo,"– ""DC was a hellhole,"" he said earlier on Friday, a day after visiting some of the deployed troops. ""But now it's safe."" National Guard troops ""will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training."" It is unclear if the decision to arm the troops will mean that their mission in Washington is changing. So far, troops have not taken part in law enforcement operations—which have been carried out by local police and officers from various federal agencies—and have instead been posted near local landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station, the capital's primary passenger rail transportation hub. Trump ordered troops to Washington earlier in August and took control of its police force to combat what he described as ""out of control"" crime in the city. Just last week, the Pentagon and US Army said that troops involved in the deployment—which now number approximately 2,000—would not carry weapons. Trump said that the mission has brought ""total safety"" to Washington—and that the mission could be expanded to Chicago, another Democratic-run city whose leadership has sometimes found itself at odds with the Trump administration.",Negative
