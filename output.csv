Netanyahu insists total victory over Hamas will bring the hostages home.Israel launched a massive retaliation campaign to destroy Hamas which has resulted in the death of at least 64,368 Palestinians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.It is against this backdrop that many of Israel's allies have repeatedly called for an end to the fighting in Gaza and an urgent return to ceasefire negotiations.""We are extremely concerned about the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and that's why we repeat our calls for Israel to stop the military offensive,"" said Denmark's Foreign Minister, Lars Rasmussen, on a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday.That message was politely ignored by his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa'ar, who not so subtly warned that the intention of some European nations to recognize soon Palestinian statehood would be counterproductive and could have dire consequences.Asked by a reporter where the Netanyahu government stood on highly controversial proposals to annex the Palestinian West Bank, Sa'ar said: ""We'ar said: 'We've had discussions on this issue with the prime minister and there will be a decision.'""",Negative

France is set to vote out another PM.

The situation is absolutely blocked,"" veteran political commentator Bruno Cautrs told the BBC.Marine Le Pen, parliamentary leader of the hard-right National Rally party, accused Bayrou of committing ""political suicide.""The prime minister, a consensus-luster figure from south-west France with a tendency to frown and to bluster, initiated Monday's surprise vote himself, seeking, as he explained it, to ""shock"" politicians into agreeing on a way to tackle the country's looming debt crisis.Bayrou says young people will be saddled with years of debt payments ""for the sake of the comfort of boomers"" if France fails to tackle a national debt of 114% of its annual economic output.But Bayrou's gamble—variously characterised as a kamikaze gesture, a pointless Cassandra-like prophecy, and an attempt to end his political career with a heroic act of self-sacrifice—looks almost certain to end his political career with a heroic act of self-sacrifice— looks almost certain to end in failure later on Monday.Despite some frantic last-minute discussions, it appears clear Bayrou simply doesn't have the votes.",Negative
