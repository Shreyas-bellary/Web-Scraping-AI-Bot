Gaza peace plan talks to continue as Trump says chance of a deal is 'really good' The talks in Egypt are expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war two years ago.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c708l7vgwywo,"– President Trump's plan to end the Gaza war is expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war and could determine whether a path toward ending the conflict is finally within reach.The 20-point plan, which has been agreed upon by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of 48 hostages, only 20 of whom are thought to be alive, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.The plan stipulates that once both sides agree to the proposal ""full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.""It also states that Hamas would have no role in governing Gaza, and it leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.However, after the plan was announced publicly a week ago, Netanyahu reinstated his longstanding opposition to a Palestinian state, saying in a video statement: ""It's not written in the agreement.We said we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state.""On Friday, Hamas responded to the proposal in a statement, in which the group agreed ""to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in Trump's proposal"" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.The second day of the talks, which will see Egyptian and Qatari officials holding shuttle meetings with delegations from both Israel and Hamas separately, will be taking place on the second anniversary of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel's prime minister said on Saturday that he hoped to announce the release of hostages ""in the coming days.""Trump, writing on social media, has urged everyone involved in efforts to end the Gaza war to ""move fast.""",Negative

"Why is Trump trying to deploy the National Guard to US cities? Trump says troops are needed to instill order, but Democratic states fear military overreach",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o,"– The Trump administration has moved to send 200 California National Guard troops to neighboring Oregon to respond to the protests.But US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, has temporarily blocked his action in a pair of back-to-back rulings.On Saturday, Judge Immergut blocked Trump from federalising the Oregon National Guard. ""This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,"" she wrote in her ruling.Oregon Public Broadcasting reported that federal law enforcement fired tear gas and smoke canisters to break up the protest and made several arrests.Trump has claimed the city is ""burning down,"" but Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said ""there is no insurrection in Portland, no threat to national security.""The latest clash occurred in early October when Trump tried to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, where protesters rallied outside a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building to protest its immigration enforcement tactics.All 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands have their own contingent of National Guard troops.Trump invoked this law to federalise 2,000 National Guard troops in June in order to support ICE missions.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also cited the law in a memo deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service on 28 September.""We're very confident in the president's legal authority to do this,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on 6 October.Trump has now authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago following immigration protests, particularly outside detention facilities.",Negative
New Supreme Court term will reshape Trump's powers Legal challenges have slowed Trump's attempts to expand presidential power. Now the highest US court is going to weigh in.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly959ppezeo,"– The US Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday with a docket already full of potentially significant cases that could define the scope of Donald Trump's presidential authority—and the prospect of more to come.In the eight months that Trump has been back in the White House, he has tested the limits of executive power, unilaterally implementing new policies, slashing federal budgets and workforce, and attempting to bring previously independent agencies and institutions more directly under his control.The latest brewing legal battle comes from the president's attempts to take control of state National Guard units and deploy them in cities where he claims there is public unrest and rampant crime—over the objection of local and state officials.The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticized by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority.The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws prohibit the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board—a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.The US—and global economy—is also front and center as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.",Positive

Competing proposals by Democrats and Republicans were both shot down, failing to meet the 60-vote threshold required.President Donald Trump said earlier in the day that another failed vote would trigger mass layoffs.But he hinted that he was open to trying to end the impasse and possibly strike a deal with Democrats who are sticking to demands that the legislation address healthcare.The Democratic-led bill to extend the government's funding failed first on Monday with a 45-50 vote. Its Republican counterpart then fell short of 52-42. Soon after the vote, Trump took to social media to blame Democrats for shutting down the government.""I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform.Democrats have held out on supporting the Republican-led proposal because they say it undercuts medical access for lower-income Americans.Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants - something that Democratic leaders deny.They have also said that they will work on the healthcare issue in separate legislation, after the government reopens.Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said he is currently negotiating with Democratic leadership on possible healthcare provisions.""We have a negotiation going on right now with the Democrats that could lead to very good things.And I'm talking about good things with regard to healthcare,"" he said.But Chuck Schumer, Democrats' leader in the Senate, then posted a clip of Trump's remarks to X with the statement ""THIS ISN'T TRUE.""",Positive

US Supreme Court rejects Ghislaine Maxwell appeal in Epstein case,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn83e6q7lq4o,"– The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by Ghislaine Maxwell against her sex-trafficking conviction.
