Born in the US state of Georgia in 1953, Hogan was one of the most famous names in professional wrestling history.His ""Hulk"" nickname came from comparisons to the comic-book hero portrayed on TV at the time, while ""Hogan"" was the invention of promoter Vince McMahon, who was keen for Irish representation in the WWF.Police officials said there will be an investigation, but there is no suspicious activity surrounding his death.",Positive

Thai authorities say 12 people, all civilians apart from one, were killed.Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it suffered any casualties.So why has this particular border skirmish—which kicked off after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Wednesday—spread into something so much larger?Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply last month, when Cambodia's senior leader Hun Sen deeply embarrassed Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra by leaking a phone conversation between them about the disputed border.Thai police have also begun investigating powerful Cambodian business figures alleged to be linked to underworld gambling and scam centers, while trade worth billions of dollars a year has stopped.It is not clear why Hun Sen chose to do this, burning a close personal relationship between their two families that goes back decades.The Thai government responded by expelling the Cambodian ambassador on Wednesday and recalling its own envoy, setting the stage for the latest confrontation.",Negative
